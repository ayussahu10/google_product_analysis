pixel6,This phone saved a co-worker's day,"He didn't charge his phone over night and forgot that he left his car-charger in a friend's car. Arrived at work with 9% battery and asked around if someone had a lightning cable with them. iPhones are very common in our organization, but no one had a lightning cable for him. So I turned on battery share and told him to just put his phone onto the back of my phone. He charged for over an hour, until both of us had to go into some meetings. I left him with 50% battery on his iPhone, which was enough to get him through the day. I don't know how much battery I had when I started, but after charging his phone I had 68% left."

pixel6,Android 13 Battery totally fixed (for me at least),"As we know the A13 update for P6 has been all over the place - my wife has a day 1 P6 and her battery is unaffected by the update, I have the same day 1 P6 as her and mine went from 6-8 hours SOT on A12 to 3-4 hours SOT on A13. I used to get to around midnight at 15% on A12 and on A13 I would be at 15% at 6pm or so, so a real drop in battery.

Now my battery is back to 6-8 hours SOT and I've listed the fixes below, I've done all of the below, not just a selection of them and I can use my battery like I used to before without a worry of running out of battery etc:

&#x200B;

* MOST IMPORTANT: Under settings search ""Usage"" and then select ""Usage Access"" from the search results and deny access for Device Health Services and Digital Wellbeing. For those worried about knock on effects, whilst I cannot comment on every single thing, I personally use adaptive charging according to my morning wake up alarm and I have scheduled ""Bedtime mode"" every single night - both features work perfectly post this change.
* Clear all data in the ""Device Health Services"" - not just cache, all the data
* In developer options - turn off ""mobile data always active""
* Turn off Adaptive Connectivity
* Both adaptive battery options are ON - charging battery
* Updated google play store - under settings and about there is an option to update, it should auto update, but for some (including me) it did not
* Disable the ""Pixel stand"" app, you have to go to all applications in settings and select show system apps
* Clear all wellbeing app data - not just cache, all the data
* Clear all the Android Intelligence app data - not just cache, all the data for all time

Hope this helps someone at least...

Edited 03/09/22 to add the first bullet point around Device Health Services which seems to be the most ""potent"" fix.

Edit: 21/09/22 to add another bullet point (first one) and the screenshot to show battery stats. (I KNOW that I YouTube A LOT, lol). Just wanted to show that the battery is good and healthy and I have no issues with any function or features of my phone.

Edit 10/10/22: after the October patch I do not believe the above fixed are needed. I undid all the settings mentioned above post October patch and my battery is perfect. 6 to 8 hours SOT with normal to heavy usage.

Then the support rep at Google gathered enough info from me to make sure I was under warranty and said I'd have to take the phone to a repair center.  They did not ask me to try a single troubleshooting step.  In their defense, I did list everything I'd already done, when the chat started, but you'd think they would still try something."

pixel6,Anyone still stoked on their P6?,"I've always had budget phones prior to this, save for a couple years when I had an iPhone. And they were decent, I was a fan of the Moto G series for various reasons.

But man, this Pixel 6 freaking rocks. I use it for hours every day and my experience is consistently great or good. I love the UI/Material You, I love the feel of the phone, the haptic feedback, the camera quality, etc. I don't have any complaints, really. I'm hoping I can keep this phone working for at least a couple more years."

pixel6,This phone saved a co-worker's day,"He didn't charge his phone over night and forgot that he left his car-charger in a friend's car. Arrived at work with 9% battery and asked around if someone had a lightning cable with them. iPhones are very common in our organization, but no one had a lightning cable for him. So I turned on battery share and told him to just put his phone onto the back of my phone. He charged for over an hour, until both of us had to go into some meetings. I left him with 50% battery on his iPhone, which was enough to get him through the day. I don't know how much battery I had when I started, but after charging his phone I had 68% left."

pixel6,Android 13 Battery totally fixed (for me at least),"As we know the A13 update for P6 has been all over the place - my wife has a day 1 P6 and her battery is unaffected by the update, I have the same day 1 P6 as her and mine went from 6-8 hours SOT on A12 to 3-4 hours SOT on A13. I used to get to around midnight at 15% on A12 and on A13 I would be at 15% at 6pm or so, so a real drop in battery.

Now my battery is back to 6-8 hours SOT and I've listed the fixes below, I've done all of the below, not just a selection of them and I can use my battery like I used to before without a worry of running out of battery etc:

&#x200B;

* MOST IMPORTANT: Under settings search ""Usage"" and then select ""Usage Access"" from the search results and deny access for Device Health Services and Digital Wellbeing. For those worried about knock on effects, whilst I cannot comment on every single thing, I personally use adaptive charging according to my morning wake up alarm and I have scheduled ""Bedtime mode"" every single night - both features work perfectly post this change.
* Clear all data in the ""Device Health Services"" - not just cache, all the data
* In developer options - turn off ""mobile data always active""
* Turn off Adaptive Connectivity
* Both adaptive battery options are ON - charging battery
* Updated google play store - under settings and about there is an option to update, it should auto update, but for some (including me) it did not
* Disable the ""Pixel stand"" app, you have to go to all applications in settings and select show system apps
* Clear all wellbeing app data - not just cache, all the data
* Clear all the Android Intelligence app data - not just cache, all the data for all time

Hope this helps someone at least...

Edited 03/09/22 to add the first bullet point around Device Health Services which seems to be the most ""potent"" fix.

Edit: 21/09/22 to add another bullet point (first one) and the screenshot to show battery stats. (I KNOW that I YouTube A LOT, lol). Just wanted to show that the battery is good and healthy and I have no issues with any function or features of my phone.

Edit 10/10/22: after the October patch I do not believe the above fixed are needed. I undid all the settings mentioned above post October patch and my battery is perfect. 6 to 8 hours SOT with normal to heavy usage.

Then the support rep at Google gathered enough info from me to make sure I was under warranty and said I'd have to take the phone to a repair center.

pixel6,Insane battery life,"I am scratching my head as to how some people are having such terrible battery life on their 6 pro.  I took my device off the charger at 7 am and it is now midnight.  I just got home from work so most of my drainage has been without wifi and I have just under 4 hours sot with 57% battery left.  I am seriously impressed!!!

I did notice a significant improvement by turning off 5g but I am curious how things have changed with this big update.  

How's everyone's battery life now that your devices have settled in?"
