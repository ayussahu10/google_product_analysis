GooglePixelxl,What happened to all in one gestures and why does the apk not install?,"I recently did a factory resest for my Google pixel xl and was going to reinstall the app so i could hide my navigation bar and prevent burn in, but its completely gone from the app store now, what happened to them? I went looking for an apk instead but none of the ones i find work they just end with app not installed everytime. I really want all in one gestures back since its the best way to hide the nav bar."

GooglePixelxl,No more in phone voice recording app have gone from a 'Pixel II' to 'Pixel XL' ?,"Hi all. I'd like to say how in past I found the voice recording app of a 'Pixel II' handy for making brief memos for myself. I miss that since, as far as I know such an app is not already present on the 'XL' . I'm wondering if that was intentional or if I'm simply not looking in the right place; hate *to be a cliche* asking here -- I do it, in part since I don't know what Canadian customer service I'd need to contact."
GooglePixelxl,What could be the issue with the phone?," Hi everyone, My Google Pixel 4 XL isnt booting up however when I hold  the power button for 7-8 seconds I see the Google logo comes up and then  disappears. Doesnt matter if its plugged into the wall outlet or not as  its doing the same thing so could this be a simple fix as changing the  battery?

GooglePixelxl,Battery draining at about 1% ever 2-3 minutes,"Recently I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge to the Google Pixel 3XL and am shocked by how much worse the battery life is.

GooglePixelxl,"Didn't think I'd say this, but during this 6 hour car ride, I'm missing the headphone jack","Sorry for this post. Just needed to vent. My initial thought about this wasn't as bad. Didn't think not having a headphone jack was a big deal. I thought people were over-reacting. But I'm currently sitting in a car, wishing I had the headphone jack so that I could listen to the movie I'm watching and charge my phone at the same time. But now it's either watch something and let my battery drain or charge my phone but not be able to watch anything. I'm in a car with people so don't want to bother them with the speakers. 


Not only that, but with the adapter I can only hear one side of my headphones. I tested it with a regular headphone jack and the headphones work just fine. 

This sucks. 


To all the people that made a big deal about this, I'm sorry. You guys were right. I'm a bit upset, but I made the choice to buy this phone. Still loving it though, just an annoyance I have to deal with :("

I am raging this is ridiculous, a joke !!!! So pretty much this is just a waste that first off the damage on a already replacement doesn't even have to do with the crack on my phone , so pretty much I have to forget about my super cool phone because of this idiotic logic behind this warranty, because there's no way in hell I will pay extra money in order for them to replace a replacement that apparently is worse that the phone with for replaced before , I can assure you if this happens I will join my husband and turn into a new iPhone user 100% guaranteed, I promise .

I called two days ago because my phone started acting up just restarting over and over for no reason and besides that every time I received a call or text it would freeze and then restart as well, after doing everything possible with technical support and factory resetting, it was still doing the same thing , today I called again and explained to the lady my situation...when she was ready to process a replacement request ,I explained to her just to be clear that two days ago someone number against me and knocked my phone of hand and a corner of my back glass had cracked, she then proceeded to tell me , that ""I have to take my phone to a third party repair person , pay out of my pocket for the glass replacement and then call again Google technical support to process the replacement other wise Google would charge me a full price for the phone "" are they stupid , how does this make sense, first off do you know how much money this phone cost for you to tell me this?! I am raging this is ridiculous, a joke !!!! So pretty much this is just a waste that first off the damage on a already replacement doesn't even have to do with the crack on my phone , so pretty much I have to forget about my super cool phone because of this idiotic logic behind this warranty, because there's no way in hell I will pay extra money in order for them to replace a replacement that apparently is worse that the phone with for replaced before , I can assure you if this happens I will join my husband and turn into a new iPhone user 100% guaranteed, I promise .

GooglePixelxl,What happened to all in one gestures and why does the apk not install?,"I recently did a factory resest for my Google pixel xl and was going to reinstall the app so i could hide my navigation bar and prevent burn in, but its completely gone from the app store now, what happened to them? I went looking for an apk instead but none of the ones i find work they just end with app not installed everytime. I really want all in one gestures back since its the best way to hide the nav bar."
GooglePixelxl,8.0 Picture in picture!,"Okay guys! So I just updated to stable Oreo and picture in picture STILL does not work! 

Still don't have the new Google Now feed, and still don't have the play protect in the play store. Oh and all the ""new"" launcher features are non existenant on tablets (pixel c).


Anyone get picture in picture to work on YouTube though? I don't have YouTube red."

GooglePixelxl,No more in phone voice recording app have gone from a 'Pixel II' to 'Pixel XL' ?,"Hi all. I'd like to say how in past I found the voice recording app of a 'Pixel II' handy for making brief memos for myself. I miss that since, as far as I know such an app is not already present on the 'XL' . I'm wondering if that was intentional or if I'm simply not looking in the right place; hate *to be a cliche* asking here -- I do it, in part since I don't know what Canadian customer service I'd need to contact."
GooglePixelxl,What could be the issue with the phone?," Hi everyone, My Google Pixel 4 XL isnt booting up however when I hold  the power button for 7-8 seconds I see the Google logo comes up and then  disappears. Doesnt matter if its plugged into the wall outlet or not as  its doing the same thing so could this be a simple fix as changing the  battery? Please see the video here [https://youtu.be/hRxbtc6-CpY](https://youtu.be/hRxbtc6-CpY).

GooglePixelxl,Battery draining at about 1% ever 2-3 minutes,"Recently I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge to the Google Pixel 3XL and am shocked by how much worse the battery life is.  At work using bluetooth headphones to listen to Spotify my battery can drain 15-20% in 2 hours.  Disabling everything but wifi and just surfing the reddit application on wifi it can drain by about 1% every 2-3 minutes, is this normal?"

GooglePixelxl,"Didn't think I'd say this, but during this 6 hour car ride, I'm missing the headphone jack","Sorry for this post. Just needed to vent. My initial thought about this wasn't as bad. Didn't think not having a headphone jack was a big deal. I thought people were over-reacting. But I'm currently sitting in a car, wishing I had the headphone jack so that I could listen to the movie I'm watching and charge my phone at the same time. But now it's either watch something and let my battery drain or charge my phone but not be able to watch anything. I'm in a car with people so don't want to bother them with the speakers. 


Not only that, but with the adapter I can only hear one side of my headphones. I tested it with a regular headphone jack and the headphones work just fine. 

This sucks. 


To all the people that made a big deal about this, I'm sorry. You guys were right. I'm a bit upset, but I made the choice to buy this phone. Still loving it though, just an annoyance I have to deal with :("
