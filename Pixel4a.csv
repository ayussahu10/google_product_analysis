Pixel4a,Android 12 sucks,"I know that some folks have Android 12 installed for months, but I updated today and here are my thoughts:

1. Why they removed icon shape settings? (I know that I can install 3rd party launcher and change it, but what's the point?)
2. At a glance widget in top left corner. Like wtf? Why not on the right or in the middle? Why so small?
3. Big bubbly icons - meh
4. Stretching rubber effect everywhere - when you pull on the top or on the bottom of the screen. Wtf? And you can't turn it off.
5. Can't change WiFi and cellular signal icon look.
6. SoT is missing.
7. You can't turn on/off WiFi or data with one click now. Now it is 3 clicks. Oh just f-off google.

Visually, Android 12 is a downgrade. I know that we all gonna get used to it, but Google is being Google here. Why just not keep an option to choose old design in settings... Previous versions of vanilla Android (before 11) were very limited in terms of customization, in 11 they added more features and now they took them back.

And this one is from The Verge - ""Material You design, which lets you go a little deeper to tweak the look of the homescreen to your liking"" hahaha. You can't do shit now.

Edit 1. Added 6. & 7.

Edit 2. Difference between Android and iOS wanes. I will think twice if my next phone will be Pixel, because it's not being sold in my country and now extra hustle to get Pixel is just not worth it. New iPhones 12 & 13 (and I am not a fan of Apple) are destroying Pixel in almost every aspect (ok you won't buy iphone for 349 with such camera, but that's only feature). And now they decided to remove customization. Pathetic."

Just sharing this so people do not wait at ""preparing..."" for an hour as I almost did.

BTW:  I like what I see on my 4a so far.  Only complaint thus far:  I would have preferred the fingerprint sensor to stick out a little more.  It is harder to find by feel.  Hopefully I will adjust to it over time."

Pixel4a,Android 12 has killed Pixel 4a for me. How has your experience been with the update so far?,"Ever since I updated the phone to the much awaited android 12, I've realised that I've never been so annoyed with my phone. The overall performance has become extremely poor and there's a noticeable amount of lag in each and every transition that happens while normal usage. The app loading time has miserably increased, there's a lot of lag in all the social media apps while scrolling, and hell, even the notification panel lags! 

I mean at this point of time, you can get a much better performing device at one third of its price. As much as I loved this phone earlier, I'm now hating it every single minute. I'm sorry if it hurts the sentiments of the Pixel fanboys here, but this is all coming from my personal experience after the update. I'd still love it if Google tries to fix it in their upcoming updates (though hopes aren't high).

EDIT: After getting this suggestion from a lot of people here, I finally did a full factory reset and restored from the backup. The performance has significantly improved since then! Although it took me some time do it all, but in the end it was all worth it :D
Thanks for the suggestion, folks. Cheers!"
Pixel4a,I got a special feature in my pixel 4a. Thankyou Google for making my phone unique. Please turn up the volume and enjoy the crackling sound that came with my new phone. Nd I got a bubble near the camera module as well.,

Pixel4a,Android 11 Intermittent Bluetooth Issues,"I updated to Android 11 yesterday afternoon on my Pixel 4a and ever since I've begun to have bluetooth issues. I first noticed this morning when my bluetooth was connected to my car and the music stopped for 10-15 seconds multiple times throughout songs on my way to work. I chalked it up to some spotty service since I wear bluetooth headphones on my walk from car to office and didn't experience any issues. 

But then that afternoon when I got in the car and also when I got home and used my bluetooth speaker I experienced the exact same issue. I attempted to recreate it with the headphones this time and after a bit I did run into issues. I also noticed that my phone itself didn't respond well to unlocking, app switching, or music pausing when the issue was occuring as if the android OS itself was hanging. 

Prior to the update I didn't have any issues with bluetooth connectivity so I believe the issue is with the update and was hoping some of you might be able to help shed light on the issue. 

Troubleshooting steps I've tried so far:

 - Hard reset phone and force quit all apps, power off for 5 minutes, turn back on
 - Disconnect and reconnect bluetooth to said devices
 - Check Google Play store for updates
 - Check RAM usage of phone (no different than normal)
 - Disconnect and reconnect from cellular network

Troubleshooting I haven't tried:
 - Roll back to Android 10
 - Factory reset phone
 - Check with multiple programs (only used spotify for bluetooth listening since the issue arose)
 - Uninstall and reinstall Spotify
 - Change bluetooth channel and settings in dev options

Is anyone else having an issue with their bluetooth since updating? Anything work for fixing it?

Edit: It appears that while having my phone locked and connected via bluetooth to play music or sound, that I run into this issue more often. With the phone unlocked I still experience this issue but it's more intermittent. It feels many times as if the entire OS is freezing/hanging when the issue occurs and then begins running again shortly after."

Google finally did it.

What I loved about the Nexus 5 - a minimalist, low-cost, high-value android device, Google has recreated with the Pixel 4a.

On top of that, they improved upon my last phone (a Pixel 3) in the exact ways the Pixel 3 suffered.  An edge to edge display with great buttons and a headphone jack.  The design is SO sleek. 

I haven't found one issue with it.  The two things I heard about were the performance or the selfie cam.  Both are at or better than I was expecting.  No speed or stutter issues, and the selfie cam is perfectly fine for my needs."

It comes down to some some but incredibly important elements: the size of the phone is perfect for one handed use (6a slightly too big for most), the back finger scanner is genius (6a's front bright thing is a living nightmare) , the phone remains fast and smooth (the speed increase of the 6a doesn't really bring that much value day to day) and the battery lasts long enough for most users. I got the 6a and - because of these major weaknesses - I had to send it back. Long live the tough little 4a, designed with intelligence and grace."

Pixel4a,"I managed to access and backup my 4a from beyond what I thought was the point of no return (shattered screen/no visual, broken touch input)","Perhaps this is not as clever as I think it is, but I figured I had to share this somewhere in case it can help out someone in the future.

Here were all of the limitations I faced in trying to access my Pixel 4a after accidentally shattering it this weekend:

* **No visuals whatsoever**: It was a completely black, spider-webbed screen. Some of my best work

* **No touch input on the glass**: When I started my troubleshooting, I didn't know this for *certain*, but I did confirm it through this process

* **No audio feedback**: I had my phone in DND mode with all of the ringers/keyboards to 0

* **No SIM or Wi-Fi connectivity**: This one was a very unfortunate kicker. The phone was on airplane mode when it broke

* **No OTG to hardwire a display with HDMI**: Y'all probably already know this, but I found this out the hard way after buying a $20 USB-C hub with HDMI-out to try and simplify this issue. Google explicitly *disables* OTG support through the USB-C port on Pixel phones, to encourage more usage of Cast functionality. Of all of the limitations, I will say - this is the one that *infuriated* me because it was not self-imposed and it's purely an anti-consumer decision by Google.

As you can see, it's easier to list out what I *did* have when I started, which was merely:

* **A working phone-back fingerprint sensor**: I could feel the vibration feedback when I used my finger on this. I knew that the phone was locked, because it kept giving me the same rumble - no matter how many times I tried it. This was because the phone wanted my PIN for its initial log-in after restart

Okay, so - here's how I got in, backed up my photos, transitioned my Google Authenticator OTPs to a different device, and got ready for my Pixel 6 which should arrive by EOW.

1. Plugged in a USB-C hub I had to plug in a wired mouse and keyboard. 
2. Once connected, I kept ""flicking"" the mouse up (while clicking) and then typing PIN + Enter on your keyboard. **I did this until the fingerprint sensor on the back no longer gave me vibration feedback.** That's how I knew I was successfully logged in.
3. Used the Windows key shortcut on the external keyboard to summon Google Assistant. This, to me, is the Rosetta Stone to this whole thing. First, most critical command was, ""Turn off Airplane Mode""
4. Hoping that Airplane mode was indeed off, I turned on my Sony XM4's to check Bluetooth. Once I heard ""Bluetooth connected"" - I knew I finally had audio feedback back!
5. Now, I could do Google Assistant requests with more feedback. Next commands were ""Turn off Do Not Disturb"" and ""Play Spotify"" (primarily to check that WiFi was connected)
6. Now that I had audio, WiFi, and some level of input (through the wired keyboard), we were ready to take it home: **Google Assistant ""Turn on Talkback""**. TalkBack is the integrated screen reader for people without sight
7. With TalkBack turned on, **Google Assistant ""Open Google Home""**
8. Tabbed slowly using the external keyboard, and listened to all options within the Google Home homepage. As soon as I heard ""<Chromecast on the same WiFi network"", used Alt+Enter to ""engage"" the button
9. Tabbed through the specific Chromecast page in the Home app, until I got to the **""Cast my Screen""** button. Alt+Enter to engage. There were 2 more screens in this path before it will *actually* cast your screen ([link here for video with these screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzIiigq9q2U)). Kept listening, and Alt+Enter'ing when relevant.
10. **HUZZAH!** Phone is now casted to my TV to back-up and do everything I need. The input lag of casting makes the external mouse + keyboard *even wonkier* to use, but even if it's slow - at least it works.

This was a bit stressful, but the problem-solving of it all was actually pretty satisfying. However, it does still make me angry that 75% of this would not have been necessary if Google simply did not remove OTG-support from their own devices out of a shitty desire to force their cast features on users."

Pixel4a,Google should have given Android 14 to the Pixel 4a,"Obviously the signs are pretty obvious that without being part of the beta program there's no plans for the Pixel 4a (the non 5G variant) to get Android 14.

At first I didn't think much about this but upon further research, this phone was released right around the cutoff of the release of Android 11. It was on Android 10 for barely any time at all. Effectively, the phone was released with Android 11 outside of the first month or two. 

The phone was also released late, unlike it the a series now which is released in April or May. It was delayed several times. 

As a result it's just sort of bad timing that the pixel 4a doesn't get the update by a matter of weeks."

Pixel4a,Pixel 4a can be used as wifi extender/repeater,"I just discovered that Pixel 4a can act as a wifi extender/repeater.

On my desktop, i have PCIe Wifi card which connects to my wifi router on other side of my house. Due to some settings (which i'm looking into), i can't get 2.4Ghz signal and just the 5Ghz which is not ideal because of walls and distance.

Out of frustration, i turned on my phone hotspot to use the 4G connection and did speed test to make sure i was getting enough speed for uninterrupted work. To my surprise, i got insane speed which i usually don't get on my 4G connection. I checked again and i noticed 2 things, my phone's wifi didn't turn off automatically (which used to happen in my older OG Pixel when using hotspot) and [fast.com](https://fast.com) showed my broadband provider as my internet provider, not the mobile operator. Then i realized my phone was acting as an extender and relaying my wifi connection. I, then, disabled my mobile data to make sure this was the case, which proved to be so.

I was planning to get a dedicated extender but might not need to now.

After a few googling, i see another user posting the same for Pixel 3. However, i still wanted to share as some people might not be aware of this like me, and also because i'm so happy :D. I guess google made some changes to their chip since that time.

TLDR; Pixel 4a can be used as wifi extender/repeater.

Edit: It seems the feature is called 'Wifi sharing' and was covered in articles as well. Just sharing one of the links:

[https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/google-pixel-3-xl-wi-fi-repeater-sharing-functionality-1942985#:\~:text=However%2C%20both%20new%20Pixel%20phones,data%20network%20with%20other%20devices](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/google-pixel-3-xl-wi-fi-repeater-sharing-functionality-1942985#:~:text=However%2C%20both%20new%20Pixel%20phones,data%20network%20with%20other%20devices).

There was no signs of any package tampering from FedEx and looked to still be sealed from the shipping facility. 


 I have a case open with their customer service right now and they have escalated it to their supervisor.  Fingers crossed I get a replacement sent out soon. 

 Anyone else been through this before? I know I have horror stories about warranty claims in the past. 

 I was so excited and then so sad.

Edit: after some more pictures were exchanged, Google is now issuing me a replacement device. Took a week to get my claim completed but overall I'm very happy with my experience and thankful Google resolved my issue with minimal needs on my part.

Pixel4a,Wow is this phone amazing,"Had the s20 fe before today and couldn't stand it because of the touch screen issues, software and how big it is. Got it exchanged for a pixel 4a and wow! It's so so much better than the s20 fe. I couldn't care less about the 730 vs the 865 it feels just as snappy. Could care less about 120hz.

The material is great I couldn't care less about the plastic which is actually better than glass. Surprisingly the speaker sounds so much better than the s20 fe. It sounds fuller and less bland.

However the biggest thing is the software. I opened up Snapchat and it feels just as good as the iOS version (coming from someone who's used iPhones for most of their life.) Same with instagram.

Just an overall fantastic device and I hope they continue to release the A series more"
Pixel4a,What sadist at Google thought a super bright screen was a good idea for the snooze button?!,
Pixel4a,Just arrived! (UK),
Pixel4a,Google doesn't wanna sell phones (in Europe),"Hey, just wanna vent a little. Feel free to ignore me.

Why is Google's marketing so bad? At least here in Europe.

I really wanted to get the new Pixel 4a, but even a week before its alleged release in Europe (especially Germany) there is no information at all about when it's actually in stores.

There is no advertisement at all. I asked several stores (like MediaMarkt and Saturn) and providers (like Telekom) and NOBODY could tell me when this phone arrives, how much it will cost or if it is available with a dataplan.

If I chose to buy it directly from google, the expected shipment says something around 27th October, but some reported that their preorder didn't go through.

My phone's screen is completely broken and I have waited 3 weeks hoping that there will be any news. But fucking none!

So I got a nice deal on a Galaxy S10 yesterday.

It's a shame really. Google could sell so much more with a transparent marketing strategy, but I guess they don't need the money or don't really care about the european phone market.

Well google, maybe next time.

Thank you for your time."
Pixel4a,Got lucky at Best Buy yesterday,
Pixel4a,Guess I'll wait..,
Pixel4a,Pixel 4a eye strain,"Been using the phone for two days. I'm getting very noticeable eye strain browsing and reading on the 4a. It's most likely PWM dimming on the OLED screen. The same thing happened when I tried an iPhone X and the Samsung S20 Plus. My previous OLED phones including Pixel 2 and Pixel 3a gave me no issues at all. I guess I'll have to return the 4a and I'm so bummed out! The phone is gorgeous, svelte, exactly the form factor I wanted. When will smartphone companies address PWM eye strain? So bummed.

EDIT: This video demonstrates the screen flicker pretty well. All three phones are set to 50% brightness and the PWM is very obvious on the 4a versions: https://youtu.be/0gIOxAZBhhc Skip to :52 seconds in. The Pixel 5 is chugging along which bodes well. I may be ordering the 5 if reviews continue to be positive.

EDIT #2: Okay I've been using the Pixel 5 for a couple days. **The short version is that the PWM is better on my eyes and it probably won't bother me much.** The 5 camera is nice (duh) and I like the warmer photos and sharper video. However, I'm still returning the 5 for other reasons. Read on if you're interested.

(This next part won't bother most people, but it's important to me. The color depth of the Pixel 5 is lacking, even compared to my old Pixel 3a. If I had to guess, I'd say they're using the LG P-OLED again for the 5. I don't know for sure of course. It's much improved over the Pixel 3 display - now there's no 'black crush' - so midtones are brighter, which is good news. But the colors on the 5 are still dull, reds are muddled and never appear bright, blues look purplish and there's no true blue, there's no teal, dark to light green gradients appear all the same bright neon green. I need better color representation for my job. So again, this is really not important for most people.)"

I'm sure many of you who use whatsapp have faced a lag while clicking pictures/taking videos on the whatsapp app. I've raised the issue on Android bug tracker (11, 12 beta, 12 wide release) and have also raised it with WhatsApp (Meta/Facebook/that bag of exploding beans). But so far, I've never received a resolution or even a reason for the issue.

I get it, the app developer has to fine tune their app to the mobiles and there are way too many OEMs when it comes to Android. But it's a device made by Google, for god's sake. Should we not expect one of the most widely used apps to be optimised for Android on a Google Phone?

Pixel4a,PIXEL BATTERY DRAIN,I've always had decent battery on my 4a and I used to charge it maybe once a day before android 12 but now I'm noticing the battery draining much faster after the android 12 update. I've also noticed that there's a random app called media storage which seems to be draining my battery on the background for app usage. Does anyone know how to fix these issues?

Pixel4a,Farewell Old Friend,"After two years and two phones, my Pixel 4a journey has come to an end.

My first 4a died at the end of year 1, after the charging port died. That was replaced under the two year warranty, however the charging port on the replacement 4a died a month after the two year warranty expired, so it was upgrade time.

I now have a Pixel 6a.

The 4a seemed like a worthy replacement for the 3a, however the 6a is a totally different animal to the 4a.

The 4a was light as a feather, like the 3a. You could barely feel it in your pocket. It was a pleasure to own and use.

 The 6a is heavy and clunky. They've gone for that 'high end' feel, which I hate. 

Goodbye my friends and I'll see you on the 6a sub."
Pixel4a,"8 months left of security updates, then what?","According to [Google](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-xl-a-a-g-a-g), after August 2023 Pixel 4A phones will not be ""guaranteed"" to receive security updates anymore (same goes for Android version updates). 

What are the options here? I have no intention to toss away a perfectly functioning device, and I intend to keep using it at least for another 2-3 years, what are objectively the risks I'm exposing myself to? Are there any hopes for Google to extend at least the security updates? 

\[Rambling mode ON\] I don't get why we get all mad at Microsoft for their decade long OS support and at the same time accept such ridiculously short time windows from any phone company, even for devices that are getting more expensive than laptops..."
Pixel4a,Nothing left but to say good-bye...,"I am a HUGE fan of this phone. It has been the best phone I've ever owned, hands down. And for 2+ years now it has been reliable in every possible way and made me a tried-and-true fan of what Google is doing with their phones. It wasn't without its flaws too, but the good far outweighed the bad. If it weren't for the fact that the battery life was a shadow of its former self, I never would have traded it for my 6a (which, after a week now, I absolutely love now too). Google's Black Friday deals made it an easier decision. It's been great being a part of this forum and this group of 4a fans. To be honest, I hated having to trade it in, but it was time. Who knows...one day I may pop on eBay or something and grab me another one just to keep around as a backup. Anyway, it's been a great ride, so I guess there's nothing left to say but...good-bye. Cheers to you all!

Pixel4a,Some shots of my new friend with my pixel 4a,
Pixel4a,I'll miss the 4a,"I've had the Pixel 4a since late Jan 2021, came from a Samsung A3 (4.7"" screen) and an iPhone 4s (3.5"" screen) before that.

Next year I'll switch back to iPhone; but even with all its quirks and idiosyncrasies (late notifications, so-so battery life, no IP rating, random Google Assistant activation, etc..), I'll surely miss this phone.

The SD 730G moves ~~pretty much~~ everything smoothly enough for me, the perfectly sized 5.8"" OLED screen is still a joy to look at, **the size and weight make it an absolute pleasure to handle,** AOD is a very good feature and nicely implemented, the fingerprint reader is as convenient as it gets... And don't even get me started on that wonderful, point and shoot camera... **It's been so, so much fun filling the Photos gallery**. Probably the first phone that made me understand why cameras on smartphones get as much attention as they do nowadays.

I remember everyone raving and recommending this phone when it came out: everywhere I looked pointed towards this phone as the one to buy under 400$; so much that it felt like a no-brainer to look elsewhere. Well, happy to say it lived (and still does) up to expectations. The reviews were right.

&#x200B;

Is not like I'll be switching tomorrow haha, but thought about writing this little *ode* and show some love to the little 4a while it's still kicking around."
Pixel4a,So in love with my new Pixel 4a!,
Pixel4a,"Snow, night mode. #pixel4a",
Pixel4a,Is the Pixel 4a still the best Google phone that isn't XL/big?,"Please correct me if I am wrong. I plan to buy a Pixel 4a because I think it's the best phone that is in a smaller size. 

The 5a looks a little too big for me.

4a seems like the only decent Google phone that you can still buy new for an ok price and that isn't that huge."
Pixel4a,BRING BACK AMOLED BLACK GOOGLE.,So I just updated to Android 12 and if there is a one change that I absolutely do not like it is the removal of AMOLED black. Everything is Grey now and it feels cheap. I thought about using light mode but then the notification screen shows half page of bright white light. Not ideal. The rest all I can live with but this change is what irks me the most. Immediately installed a launcher but the settings screen is Grey. I hope Google gives us the option at least to choose between grey and pitch black.
Pixel4a,Is pixel 4a worth getting in 2021?,"As you know I waited for 5a long time and when it's released its not available in my country. So Iam thinking of purchasing 4a I did see some reviews which said battery problem I don't game but I binge watch movies. I just need good user friendly experience. If anyone using using over the past few months please give your feedback and thank you for your time.
EDIT: Guys I finally got the phone it's so good like you guys mentioned in the comments thanks for your suggestions. Team pixel!!!"
