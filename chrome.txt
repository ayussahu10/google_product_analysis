                Hey Google, instead of just making ad blockers no longer work on chrome, how about you do something about the malicious ads that require me to use an ad blocker in the first place?

                                     Is it just me, or does Google need to quit trying to expand Chrome's functionality and focus back on making a web browser that actually lets me browse the web?

In the next few weeks, I will have completely shifted our entire office over to Chrome O/S without a single sacrifice in software options! Access to MS Office, IE, Adobe CS5, or anything, with no modifications to the Chrome device.
