GooglePixel5,"Mystery Icon In Status Bar After Time, Upper Left Status Bar","Hi my phone said I needed to download an update teo days ago. I clicked the update button and it started to download. Then I went to a different app. The whole thing disappeared and I don't know if it went through.
Since that day though I've been seeing an icon to the right of the time, in the upper left corner. I don't know what it is, but it wasn't there before.
Is this some time of virus, malware or phishing scam?
I checked my Android version, it's version 12 and the last security update was July 5, 2022. I'm so confused.
Edit: the icon looks like a white box with criss crossing black lines. I'm thinking now it could be AVG antivirus but not sure. 
If that's AVG, I've never seen it there before."
GooglePixel5,Google Pixel 5 Adaptive Connectivity,"I've seen comments and opinions about AC on here, but can't find any specifically related to what I'm wondering.  My phone has it on by default, but I use Signal App for texts and calls to a few people, which uses data, and I have noticed that they will tell me they've called or texted multiple times and my phone never made a sound, until I pick it up and it becomes active.  Then I get ALL missed call and text notifications! Does adaptive connectivity cause the wifi / mobile data etc to sleep when phone is not active?  I can't have this.  Will it help to turn this feature off?"
