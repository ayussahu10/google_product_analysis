Last week 12/10 I noticed uBlock Origin developer Raymond Hill posted the following on Adblock Pro's Chrome Web Store review page,

>""I am the developer of uBlock Origin.

>This is essentially the same code base as an older version (circa 1.7.4) of uBlock Origin, but with Google Analytics hook added to the manifest. Note the absence of privacy policy.

>Also aside google-analytics.com, whoever is behind this extension added another Content Security Policy directive which should really not be needed (the ability to embed Flash objects in the extension code itself). I consider this suspicious.

>Also, the maintainer of Adblock Pro apparently does not want users to find out that the code was taken from the uBlock Origin project, the ""About"" pane has been removed from the dashboard.

>Just use the real uBlock Origin: you get a more up to date version (1.10.0 as of writing), without any analytic hooks in the code base.""

The comment can be found by sorting the reviews by English and recent and scroll to December 3.

I see this happening a lot and Adblock Pro's over 2 million users probably don't realize this at all.

It's pretty simple. Checks if a commenter matches against a list of blacklisted IDs and removes the comment if it does.

If you feel like it, maybe you can update the blacklist or otherwise improve the extension:

[https://github.com/hadalin/chrome-hidefedora](https://github.com/hadalin/chrome-hidefedora)

**UPDATE:**

Updated the list with more fedoras. Have to come up with a way to do this more easily. There's so many of them.

**UPDATE 2:**

Made Firefox version too
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-fedora/

**UPDATE 3:**

Published a new version. The plugin now consumes less CPU. Actually it consumes no CPU after the comments are removed and no new comments loaded.

Chrome might ask you to accept additional permissions because I tweaked that also (basically you are allowing the plugin to modify comments section and read the blacklist from github).

**UPDATE 4:**
You know what might piss them off? If you replied to their comment saying something like *Congratulations, you've been added to Hide Fedora browser extension blacklist.*

**UPDATE 5:**
**NOW YOU CAN REPLACE FEDORAS WITH CAT PICTURES**

Added an options page where you can choose fedora comment removal method.

If you're impatient you can manually [update your chrome extensions](http://lifehacker.com/5805239/how-to-manually-update-your-chrome-extensions) to get the latest version. You will be asked to accept additional permissions to allow saving settings.

**UPDATE 6:**

Major update. Fedora list is now fetched from an outside source.

You can now report reddit armie from the comments. Or you can hide the button from the options page.

**UPDATE 7:**

It seems that the extension stops working if you log out of Chrome. Will try to fix this. In the meantime you can try logging back in.

**UPDATE 8:**

Some users are reporting that the Chrome extension is not working even if they are logged in. [You can try resetting Chrome settings](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3296214?hl=en).

**UPDATE 9:**

YouTube changed comments HTML structure which caused the extension to stop working. Updated Chrome extension (new version is 1.7.3).

Chrome extension will ask you to accept new permissions (read and change your data on jhvisser.com and youtube.com). This is because YouTube comments are no longer inside an iframe. You can see all changes [here](https://github.com/hadalin/chrome-hidefedora/commit/b373120e353b037f8900ff736bdfabf118a21748) and discussion [here](https://github.com/hadalin/chrome-hidefedora/issues/53).

Chrome,"PSA: Reddit Enhancement Suite and ""the new permissions""...","Hiya all.

I'm the author of Reddit Enhancement Suite.  I realize a lot of you already know about the permissions confusion, but I've just recently noticed that I got a ton of [negative and slanderous reviews](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb/reviews) because of confusion about the permissions, so I'd like to re-explain them again.

Tens of thousands of RES users uninstalled due to those reviews. I'm not too upset about the # of installed copies, but those reviews are all top-rated due to people clicking ""yes"" that they're helpful - which reflects very poorly (and falsely) on me to newcomers to the addon who read the reviews page.


**TL;DR**: RES does not collect or harvest your data AT ALL.  The messaging from Chrome is confusing at best, misleading at worst.  I'll explain each permission below...

- **history** - the history permission is required in order to add URLs that you expand using the inline image viewer to your history (e.g. ""make them purple"")

- **cookies** - the cookies permission is required for Account Switcher to work. RES needs to be able to reset your logged-in cookie before attempting to log you into another account.

- **tabs** - the tabs permission allows RES to communicate between open tabs of reddit so that a change you make to settings, data, etc in one tab is propagated to other reddit tabs you have open.

- **flickr, imgur, other sites**: - this is the one where google really upsets me... they say ""RES has access to **your data** on ... sites"" -- this is NOT THE CASE.  RES needs permission to call out to imgur, flickr etc in order to get the direct URL to each image in an album, for example -- or to flickr to get the direct URL to the one image that is linked. This is what allows you to expand it without leaving the homepage.


Unfortunately, because Chrome's permissions dialog is confusing, the following happened:

1) the dialog doesn't talk about which permissions are new vs. old - so people who *ignored* the history/tabs/cookies permission the first time though ""wow, the new RES update is asking me for all this stuff?! what the HELL!?"" - I can't really blame them... but many of them have slandered me in the reviews saying I'm ""collecting their data and selling it to marketers"" - which is 100% untrue.

2) Not only is the dialog not very clear, but it's also worded pretty scarily - it tells users that I may be doing all sorts of sketchy stuff.  Technically, those permissions allow me to, but [RES is open source](http://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite) and you can check for yourself that I'm not.  Further, if you're concerned that what's on github isn't what's in the Chrome extension - chrome extensions are just zip files! You can decompress it and compare if you don't trust me.

So, having seen the slanderous reviews and taking it a little bit personally (it's upsetting. I've worked very hard to build a reputation of trustworthiness and generosity by being honest/forthright, and not being in your face about donations, etc) - I wanted to set the record straight with Chrome users who are confused or upset by these permissions dialogs.

Thanks for reading...

Chrome,Google Chrome update replaced 'Search Google for Image' with 'Search Image with Google Lens',"Google just forced desktop users to switch over to their stupid mobile app Lens in the right-click context menu, after the same release came with a UAF vulnerability in V8 for 2.5 billion devices.

Lens is trash. I just wanted to test it out, so I used Image Search and Lens on the same image, and Lens came back with ""No results found for the selected area"" and Image Search came back with ""About 294 results (1,06 seconds)"".

Is that the ""new machine learning and AI capabilities"" they're trying to get over people with?

There's no excuse. Just another example of how out-of-touch and half-baked the chrome devs are, they take a year to roll out broken software and deactivate what worked.

How long until they deactivate ""*chrome://flags/#enable-lens-region-search*"" like all the other chrome flag fixes? Knowing Google they're probably going to deactivate Image Search instead to eliminate competition with a better product.

Chrome,Chrome 71 Awful UI changes.,"I have been using the default UI ever since I started using Chrome.  When chrome 69 came out, and the hideous changes were made to the user interface were implemented (horrible looking bubbled tabs, small dark grey lines separating each tab), I immediately googled and found a solution to revert it to it's superior original state:  go to chrome://flags/, search for  ""**UI Layout for the browser's top chrome""** and use the dropdown box to change it from default to normal, so me and many others who dislike this layout can be rid of the new horrendous looking UI.  However, today when I turned on my computer I was greeted with this issue again.  So, I thought no problem; I'll change it back.  However, Google decides, nahhhhh. WE like our UI changes better than our old one.  In Chrome 71 we're just gonna have to go ahead and REMOVE the option to change it despite what others may prefer.  
This is absolutely ridiculous.  The fact that we (as users) can't choose our own damn UI is ridiculous.  As much as I hate any other browser available, I hate this new UI more.  I am seriously thinking of making the switch to Firefox instead if I can't find a way to switch this back.  Either using an extension, or Google just decided to put the option to change the UI, this needs to be changed.  Is anyone aware of how to change it back?

Chrome,Manifest v3 Discussion and Impact on AdBlockers,"With Google announcing the rollout times for Manifest v3 probably this month, here you can discuss it and its impact

Manifest V3 is a new version of the software that runs Chrome browser extensions:

* Google claims that the main goal of Manifest V3 is to improve the security and privacy of your browsing experience

* It does this by placing stricter limits on what extensions can do and how they can access your personal information

* Some developers are concerned that these changes will make it harder for them to create certain types of extensions, such as adblockers



>Google is controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks

Manifest V3's changes to the extension platform will make it more difficult for adblockers to function effectively. 

This is because the new version will limit the ability of extensions to block certain types of ads, giving website owners and advertisers more control over what users see. 

As a result, some adblockers may not work as well or may stop working altogether, making it harder for users to control the ads they see while browsing the web.

Description says `Ublock Origin, an efficient blocker. Thousands of popular block ads.` Images contain screenshots of the real uBlock0. The logo was stolen from the real one too.

What's strange is that it's the #1 result I get by searching ""ublock origin"" https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/ublock%20origin


As if Google deliberately wants users to install the scam and not the real one. Aren't they manually reviewing every app before publishing them? What are the chances that the Google employee who reviews the apps has never heard of uBlock and didn't realize he was authorizing a fake one?  Come on Google.

This needs to be investigated before someone gets infected. Ridiculous that someone HAS to get infected before Google starts enforcing the quality.

And no, I'm not wearing any tinfoil. I used it all to cook mah turkey yesterday ;)

**UPDATE 2:** This is also his website http://www.z1z2z3z4.com/ , would be nice if Google can investigate to make sure the developer is not infecting users.

**UPDATE 3:** Looks like all the extensions, except for the fake [Hideman VPN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hideman-vpn/jiicoamlefgfcjdiaoggmclhndecenpm) were removed.

If I clicked with the right button and use the context menu it would save as their original format, but I oftentimes drag the files to folders/my desktop and got the wrong file, so it was really annoying.

[https://i.imgur.com/2M4oXH2.gif](https://i.imgur.com/2M4oXH2.gif)

Anyway, I found out it has everything to do with the header request that Chrome sent. Google has been really trying to push this format and basically the average request that chrome sent is something like:

>text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/**webp**,image/apng,\*/\*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9

Which I assume translate as ""send the image, preferably as a webp file"", anyway, I found out that if you download an extension that allows you to change the header that chrome sent to the page you can choose to not receive webp image when dragging a file .

Seems the only work around is to use the extension that u/CoLdFuSioN167 replied with, or copy it into Paint and save it there. Is it just about data saving? I wanted to know the reason for forcing this on users (with no setting to turn it on or off).

I've used Chrome for many  years, I have folders with 100's of saved images as .jpeg or .png. But seemingly out of nowhere, just this last week or so, every image I try to right click > save image as... it's only saving as .webp file type.

I do understand that there are third party extensions I can use to circumvent this - but I'd like to know why this is even happening?

When I googled solutions, I see this problem coming up over the years since 2012 or so... but I've used Chrome for a long time and only just had this start happening this month. So what's going on, why the change? Is there a solution outside of using an extension (or different browser...)?"

Edit: I figured out why it wasn't working for me. Adding the code to the end and enabling the Disable display scaling on high DPI settings button does work, but I had to make sure the entire Chrome process ended but forcing quitting it on Task Manager."

Chrome,Caution: Auto HD for YouTube extension is now injecting ads into facebook!,"The latest update for Auto HD for YouTube extension is now injecting ads into facebook pages.

The developer added a extra permission to access facebook.com, and used a disguise of a share button to justify the permission.

However, if you take a look at share.js you can see it is injecting ads into facebook. You will need to unpack the JavaScript file using something like http://jsbeautifier.org/.
  
  **UPDATE**
Developer has just updated the extension to remove facebook permission and remove the injection code.
  2.2.1.193 now looks safe, although I would personally not trust this developer anymore.

  If you are interested here is the injection code from the previous update: http://pastebin.com/RvMFkQw6

  
  **UPDATE 2**
  Uninstall it now! Developer has updated extension again and changed the application to ""AutoShare for Facebook & Youtube"". This extension is now a completely different, does Google even allow this? The ad injection code is back!
  
  Seems like he created a good extension, waited for it to get popular, then turn it into malware.
  
  ** UPDATE 3 **
  Checkout the terms for the extension: http://www.fb-smart.com/terms.html  (Google translated, it's in French)
> AutoShare for Facebook & Youtube is free, AutoShare for Facebook & Youtube gives itself the right to place at any time without advertising that is intrusive advertising.

  --
> Personally identifiable information (such as your username) are collected during the use of AutoShare for Facebook & YouTube and are used for operation
  
**UPDATE 4**
 Looks like it has been removed from the web store! Just hope Google can remote remove it from people who have already updated to the new version.

**UPDATE 5**
 Looks like its back, It's still injecting adverts via code.js. Looks like Google doesn't really care. 
  I have found several other extensions doing the same (mostly facebook based) reported all of them and all are still active. "

This is me, after giving it weeks of use, whining.
It's not intuitive, and even when you understand it, the system requires far too many clicks to be convenient. The arrows are too small to quickly click. Most of the interface is covered by a useless graphic. Changing the bookmark location, especially from one subfolder to another subfolder in a different root, is a huge pain.

Bookmarking was plenty easy before, why did they go and change it?

Chrome,"The YouTube Ratings Preview extension now collects Google search data via ""jgy3.ggclk.com"".","The extension in question in [YouTube Ratings Preview](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-ratings-preview/cgbhdenfmgbagncdmgbholejjpmmiank/). 

Last night, I noticed that URLs clicked from Google had a different URL. Normally, when hovering over Google results, it [shows the actual URL.](http://i.imgur.com/yIxGAqu.png) If you click on a link, some JS [converts the link to a ""google.com/url?"" URL](http://i.imgur.com/m8nelx5.png). However, the latest change to the YouTube Ratings Preview extension [changes these URLs to ""jgy3.ggclk.com/url?""](http://i.imgur.com/RGV7ial.png). **Disabling the extension stops this behavior.**

In the background_t.js file in the extension folder, there is a comment block that explains the change:

    /*
    
    This file is not minified so that its behaviour can be inspected and trusted by third-parties.
    
    YTRP partners with Ecosia to collect anonymous usage data that helps ecosia.org improve the
    search results of their eco-friendly search engine. To gather this data YTRP routes clicks on
    Google search results through an Ecosia click tracking url. This integration is totally seamless
    to the user and will not annoy you or interfere with your browsing experience in any way.
    
    To disable the tracking of anonymous data:
    1- Right click anywhere in youtube.com, and click ""YouTube Ratings Preview configuration"".
    2- Right click anywhere in the opened configuration page and find the corresponding option.
    
    */

The actual code is just a few lines farther down:

    // onHeadersReceived
    chrome.webRequest.onHeadersReceived.addListener(function (details)
    {
    	var ecoUR = getHeader(details.responseHeaders, ""Eco-UR"");
    	if (ecoUR)
    	{
    		setPending(details.requestId, ecoUR);
    	}
    },
    {
    	urls: ['*://jgy3.ggclk.com/url?*'], // Ecosia tracking URLs
    	types: ['main_frame']
    },
    ['blocking', 'responseHeaders']);

As it says, **you can disable the data collection** by going to the extension settings page, right clicking, going to the YouTube Ratings Preview menu, and [unchecking ""Track anonymous data""](http://i.imgur.com/akMMU0C.png). However, I no longer trust the author to not add other tracking features without my knowledge. This is just a very sketchy change, especially considering the similar behavior of the malicious ""Google redirect virus"". It was so similar, in fact, that I ran a MalwareBytes scan before playing around with Chrome extensions.

Hope this helps anyone else having the same issue."

This is annoying to me as I liked to create Web apps on my task bar, so although you could now create the shortcut, it would open in the main chrome window as a tab instead, which destroys the concept as using it as an app.

I did find the solution, they've just moved it.

So for now, what you need to do is the following:-

1.	Three dots and create shortcut. It will then create the shortcut on the desktop and start menu.
2.	In the chrome address bar go to chrome://apps
3.	Right click on the desired app in the chrome window and choose ""open in window"".
4.	The shortcuts should now open in their own window just as before.

Hope someone finds this useful.

We should have done this differently and for that **I AM DEEPLY SORRY**. Even before google removed us, we voluntarily disabled the web application and it remains down. Over 90 thousand users upgraded to this code and rather than run the risk of further alienating (and not the cool reddit kind of aliens) we took what steps we could to rectify this.

While we could have easily gotten the referrer data from the call we opted to just get the domain. Why? We are using that data to run regression code for the cases where smoothgestures runs poorly.

We're not trying to be dicks here, we just didn't think ahead and in that blatently obvious oversight cost us to have a rollercoaster of a day.

I also have another plugin called Troll Emoticons that had the same code for about 3 weeks now so we didnt really think it was a problem.
I am going this AMA about the subject, what our day has been like, and talk to you fellow redditors about how to get what we were looking for. Accurate user statistics, something that the chrome webstore lacks.

What an awesome way to recycle an old device.  ,"The last company I worked for supplied everyone with a Thinkpad and every 3 years we would get a new one and since the old ones were completely depreciated they never wanted the old ones back.  The other day I was cleaning out a storage closet and came across my old IBM (yes, pre Lenovo sale) T60 Thinkpad that had Windows XP Enterprise Edition installed.  I fired it up and while the battery won't hold a charge it was a functional, if not extremely slow, device.  Since it was an Enterprise Edition I did not have Admin level and could not do much to clean it up (for example, defrag would only run while connected to the network, which I cannot connect to since I don't work for that company anymore).  Did a little online research and discovered I could download Chromium onto a thumb drive and boot really any PC from a USB port with this simple OS.

> In the address bar of Chrome write chrome://flags/ and in the search bar that will appear below, write force color profile and hit enter. Chrome will give you a so called “experiment” named “Force color profile”.

> Checking the options included in the box at the right you see the “default”, which is currently selected and is responsible for the washed out colors, as well as some other options you can try. In my case the option that worked perfectly was scRGB linear (HDR where available). This option gave me the exact same colors I enjoy also with Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

> Perhaps in your case some other option works better. You can try all of them; nothing to lose! Each time you change color options you need also to restart the browser, but it re-opens automatically intact with all your previous tabs, including the “flags” tab with the color options. Therefore, it is really easy to try everything."

#Contents:

1. **Instructions**
2. **Description / Symptoms**
3. **Other links**
4. **How to check if you have it**  
5. **Temporary Fix**
6. **Permanent Fix**  
7. **Advice on finding the installer**

-------

# **1. INSTRUCTIONS**

Read section 2, then 4, to see if you have this extension. It uses lots of different generic names. Then follow the instructions in section 5 and 6 to disable and remove the extension and the installer. Try the advice in section 7 if you can't find the installer. If you still can't find the installer, follow the instructions in section 5 as a temporary fix until you *can* find the installer and remove it.

There's two parts to it, the extension and an installer. You need to remove *both* of them to get rid of it.

-----

# **2. DESCRIPTION / SYMPTOMS**  

Howdy, folks. There's a malicious extension that auto-installs itself on Chrome, called 'Properties' - the newer versions are sometimes called 'Configure,' 'Browser,' 'Guide,' 'Viewer,' or 'Bundle,' with a plain gear icon for the logo.

[You can see it here, as 'Properties'](https://imgur.com/a/FayttuB) and [here, as 'Viewer.'](https://i.imgur.com/9isSsMA.jpeg) It tries to hide by having a very generic name and making it difficult for you to view your Chrome extensions.

* It redirects anything you search in the URL bar through a secondary website and then to Bing.  
* It disables a lot of your other extensions, like MalwareBytes or Adblock.  
* It redirects your chrome://extensions to chrome://settings, so it's more difficult to find and remove the extension.  
* It regularly crashes your Chrome once you've removed it so it can reinstall itself.  
* When it crashes and reboots your Chrome browser, you may see a command prompt window for a split second. As far as I know, this is the malware reinstalling the extension.
* It occasionally pops up other websites at random.  
* It creates a folder called something like 'chrome_pref,' 'chrome_settings,' 'chrome_tools,' 'chrome_history,' 'chrome_view,' 'chrome_cast,' or 'chrome_tabs' in your /AppData/Local/ folder, and it uses those files to reinstall itself.

So far, the only way I've found to remove or disable the extension temporarily is to go into chrome://settings/reset and restore your settings to their original defaults. This disables all extensions and allows you to go in and remove it.

You have to be careful because the 'chrome_settings' folder will reinstall itself within a few minutes after you delete it, and the extension will reinstall itself within a few minutes after I boot Chrome. I have yet to figure out how to consistently find where the installer for the extension is.

The installer seems to be an adware or malware called 'Bloom.' Some of the more recent versions may be called 'Energy.'

Malwarebytes and ADWare couldn't find it for me, but they may have been updated since then. Malwarebytes seems to be working for some people when they look for it, so feel free to give it a try. Kaspersky might also be able to catch the installer for you.

# **3. OTHER LINKS**  

[A ton of other people have been having this issue, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/ts8tn9/chrome_auto_installs_properties_extension_i/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/t5436k/malicious_chrome_extension_reappears_after/), [and here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/sgty3z/chrome_for_mac_adware_help_reinstalling_extension/). Apparently [resetting your PC to factory settings will clear it](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerhelp/comments/ulbq9p/how_do_i_get_rid_of_the_properties_extension_on/), but I don't want to do that unless I have to.

------

# **4. HOW TO CHECK AND SEE IF YOU HAVE IT:**  

Go into chrome://settings/reset and restore your settings to their original defaults. This disables all extensions and allows you to go in and turn off the hijacker extension. 

Then do one of the following, preferably both:

------

# **5.TEMPORARY FIX (confirmed works):** 

Replacing the files in your 'chrome_settings' folder with ones that have the same name will stop the extension from installing. This is the folder that the hijacker keeps installing and which it uses to reinstall the 'Properties' extension.

It'll check for, and reinstall, those files every four minutes if you delete the folder. But if you *replace* the files in the folder with empty ones that have the same name, it fools the checker into thinking they're still there and it won't keep reinstalling.

# **6. PERMANENT FIX (confirmed to work!):**

/u/Python208 [found a fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/ui861c/properties_chrome_extension/i900dvg/): Delete the 'Bloom' folder *and* the 'chrome_settings' folder in your /AppData/Local/ folder. I just tried it and so far it has yet to reinstall itself.

Some updated versions of the installer are called 'Energy.exe' - like the extension, the installer program might be listed under different names, too.

Someone else was saying this thing waits three months once you get it, so I'll be waiting to see if it comes back. It may also have something to do with BlueStacks, the Android emulator.

**Update:** So far, this has fixed it for me for several weeks, now. I'm still waiting to see if it'll return after the three month latency is up.

------

# **7. ADVICE ON FINDING THE INSTALLER**  

You can check your startup folder to look for the installer program in Task Manager, and you can also use a program called AutoRuns for a more detailed look at startup items. You can find AutoRuns for Windows by searching for it on Google.

Since the installer program regularly checks to see if the extension is installed, you can run your Resource Monitor program to watch and see which program is reinstalling those files. You can delete the extension's files while the Resource Monitor is running and check the log to see when and how the extension files get reinstalled.

Remember, you're checking Resource Monitor's logs to see when that background installer reinstalls the extension's files. 

You may also be able to check your computer's Task Scheduler to find the installer. If so, there may be a task listed there which will share the same name as the folder the extension is installed in, such as 'chrome_cast' or 'chrome_settings,' etc.

The entry in your Task Scheduler seems to be set to run every 4 to 5 minutes or every 50 minutes. This is the installer program checking to see if the extension is still installed, and that should help you find it to remove it.

**How to open Resource Monitor:**

> From the Windows Task Manager:  

> 1. Press the Ctrl+Alt+Del keys at the same time and select Start Task Manager on the screen that appears.  
> 2. In the Task Manager, click the Performance tab, then click the Resource Monitor button or Open Resource Monitor link, depending on your version of Windows.

> **OR:**

> From the Windows desktop or Start Screen:  

> 1. Press the Windows key on your computer's keyboard.  
> 2. Type resmon.exe in the Windows search box (or, merely start typing if you use Windows 8) and press Enter."

Why force us to open tabs in groups rather than just giving us the option?

Chrome,PSA: Try disabling *all* your extensions before asking for any help,"Extension is the top cause for issues reported in this subreddit.

Please try disabling \*all\* of your extensions first before requesting any help (which is easy to do - just go to chrome://extensions/ and click all the sliders). If disabling extensions help, then you can try enabling them back and see which one is causing the problem. Then you can decide whether it's worth making a post.

On average, extensions are poorly maintained and not updated quickly. Also note that installing an extension means you are also trusting those extension developers to not lose control of their extensions. There have been many, many extensions that were either sold or the original developer lost the control. Most extension developers do not have discipline and resources to defend against a targeted attack. There are good and trustworthy extensions, but there are few, compared to the overall number of extensions. So think very carefully before installing any extensions - you absolutely want to give extra scrutiny before installing extensions with sensitive permissions like ""Read and change all your data on the websites you visit"" (e.g. most ad blocking extensions). Each extension with broad permission like that is you increasing your exposure to security issues - install them only if you trust that the developer of the extensions is capable enough and uses best security practices to defend against targeted attacks."

Chrome,Bitdefender detected a storage.googleapis.com connection as malicious - originated from Chrome?,"This morning when I booted my Win 10 machine and opened Chrome, I got several notifications from Bitdefender saying that the same Web Threat has been blocked several times in the space of a minute.

I did some digging and found that the Infected Web Resource blocked was from [storage.googleapis.com](https://storage.googleapis.com) ([http://storage.googleapis.com/update-delta/mimojjlkmoijpicakmndhoigimigcmbb/32.0.0.363/32.0.0.344/2508f55c6dcbf6f5492cc5476d08a68736d38f06c1028373d2dec53264604d3a.crxd](http://storage.googleapis.com/update-delta/mimojjlkmoijpicakmndhoigimigcmbb/32.0.0.363/32.0.0.344/2508f55c6dcbf6f5492cc5476d08a68736d38f06c1028373d2dec53264604d3a.crxd)).

The 32.0.0.363/32.0.0.344 sections of that URL lead me to think it's related to the most recent Flash Player update (32.0.0.363) released in the past 24 hours, which I can see in Chrome under  chrome://components/

If I'm understanding my Windows Event Viewer correctly ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/ea5Bwix)), it appears that Chrome had something to do with this Antivirus detection?

Any thoughts on this? Do I have a malware infection, or is this a false positive with Chrome attempting to update Flash Player from storage.googleapis.com?

**Update:** I found a similar URL in event viewer after the events that failed (I assumed due to Bitdefender's blocking of the connection) with the following URL: [http://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/release2/chrome\_component/AJQEmgfDY1m49oUulh5SKls\_32.0.0.363/EPmhipcnuv-HlKHxpCbBaw](http://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/release2/chrome_component/AJQEmgfDY1m49oUulh5SKls_32.0.0.363/EPmhipcnuv-HlKHxpCbBaw)  This contains the same 32.0.0.363 number, and I can see in  chrome://components/  that Flash Player is showing this same version number now. I can also see a bunch of events under BITS-Client in Event Viewer with [redirector.gvt1.com](https://redirector.gvt1.com) or [storage.googleapis.com](https://storage.googleapis.com) addresses with text matching the current version numbers of items in  chrome://components/

**Am I overthinking this, and this is all part of Chrome's legitimate component update process, with the Bitdefender detection being a false positive?**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**UPDATE**

Hey folks, so my Bitdefender updated itself at 11.53am NZ time this morning (20 mins ago).

Earlier in the day when I took the URL that Bitdefender was blocked and entered it into Chrome directly, the page was blocked by Bitdefender. I also tried it with one of the links another user had submitted in the comments, and the web page was also blocked by Bitdefender.

Since the 11.53am Bitdefender update this morning however, I can open the links I mentioned above in Chrome with no issue.

**Does this mean it was a false positive?**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 17 April**

A couple of days ago I submitted the URL that had popped up as blocked for me ([storage.googleapis.com](https://storage.googleapis.com) ([http://storage.googleapis.com/update-delta/mimojjlkmoijpicakmndhoigimigcmbb/32.0.0.363/32.0.0.344/2508f55c6dcbf6f5492cc5476d08a68736d38f06c1028373d2dec53264604d3a.crxd](http://storage.googleapis.com/update-delta/mimojjlkmoijpicakmndhoigimigcmbb/32.0.0.363/32.0.0.344/2508f55c6dcbf6f5492cc5476d08a68736d38f06c1028373d2dec53264604d3a.crxd)) to Bitdefender as a possible false-positive. A per my above update, the link became unblocked (I could open it in my browser fine, although TBH I wouldn't recommend doing this for [storage.googleapis.com](https://storage.googleapis.com) links because you never know what's on the other end). Later that day I got the email from Bitdefender saying they'd checked out the link, it WAS a false positive, and they'd resolve it in an update.

Chrome,Something's wrong..... I can feel it,
Chrome,Guide: Disable Chrome automatically highlighting text on sites from featured search results (AKA targetText),"**UPDATE 1:** My original fix doesn't work in new versions of Chrome.

**UPDATE 2:** /u/kuanhon has made a bookmarklet you can click to clean up a highlighted page. [Instructions](http://blog.kuan0.com/2020/08/chrome-highlights-text-on-webpages-how.html)

**UPDATE 3:** /u/everyonesdesigner has [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/gyz09c/guide_disable_chrome_automatically_highlighting/g43uknx) with a minimalistic, [open-source Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-google-search-tex/ompocnnmgiaoieoanemepjflbokldhom) they've developed to disable TargetText. I haven't tested it yet, so if you have any issues then reply to their comment I linked to.

**UPDATE 4:** I recommend downloading [Brave](https://brave.com/download/), an alternative privacy-focused Chromium browser which feels just like Chrome, if you don't want to finally switch to Firefox. The highlights are gone in Brave, but the URLs can still be monstrous because of targetText.

___

**OP:**

Chrome 80(?) has a new feature called targetText. If you click on a featured search result (*i.e.*, the first result which sometimes appears in a box at the top), it will take you to the location on the page it thinks you want and highlight the text it thinks is relevant. ([example](https://i.redd.it/wljn0o7g0uh31.png))

Some people like this. I don't. I also don't like that there's no easy way to disable it yet.

~~Fortunately, I found a way to disable it anyway, so for anyone else looking for a fix:~~

~~1. in the Chrome address bar, type chrome://flags/~~

~~2. type ""text fragment"" in search flags box~~

~~3. click ""disabled"" next to text fragment anchor~~

~~4. relaunch Chrome~~

~~Unfortunately this doesn't fix the messy URLs created by this process – for example, the above pic has the URL https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_nn/two_layer_net_module.html#targetText=PyTorch%3A%20Custom%20nn%20Modules,as%20a%20custom%20Module%20subclass. If anyone figures out how to make it return a normal URL without all that bullshit on the end, please leave a comment!~~"

* Organizing history into digestible time intervals
* Grouping visits from the same domain
* Enhancing day filters
* Using Preferences UI 
* Deleting beyond removing single visits
* Evolving the time interval interface 
* Making search actually work

I'm tired of seeing the same post  over and over again asking about getting back the old UI, or complaining about it. We get it, a lot of us hate it too, but i've seen a thousand of them already. Please mods, just make a pinned post where people can discuss it till they're blue in the face, with all the possible solutions and explanations they need in it.

Edit: A lot of people are responding negatively to this post so I thought I'd address those:

""multiple rant posts will somehow convince the chrome team to revert the new UI"" - sorry but that's not how things work because:

1. Major UI changes like this one are rarely if ever ""changed back"". They built these changes in accordance with some goal which could be anything from making chrome's design more in line with the Material design look, to making the browser more touch-friendly.
2. They also won't give you the option to keep your preferred old design and/or feature because it's costly to maintain multiple versions of the same thing.
3. Google employees don't hang out on this sub, and if they do, they don't give a shit or can't do shit
4. The only thing that might convince Google to walk back is if you ""vote with your wallet"" or in this case, CHANGE YOUR BROWSER OF CHOICE (this is why it's good to have choice and it's damn time for chrome to lost some users to other browsers). You'd still need massive amounts of people to choose to do this which is hardly likely because (see next point).
5. Unless it's severely broken, most people are unlikely to switch. the new UI may be ""terrible""/""ugly"" or buggy, but it works, and for most people, that means they'll use it grudgingly or willingly instead of switching. Look at you, you're still using it. I myself am still using chrome despite the new Views being buggy as fuck when it comes to full screen mode on Macs, a very essential feature for me (though I am trying other browsers in hope I'll find one that's better)
   1. For example, Think the new toolbar size is abhorrent? Firefox has a condensed toolbar option. Safari has a very minimal and tiny toolbar as well. Switch.
6. if you don't think the previous points are true, then at least recognise that a pinned post with all the pain points about the new UI, as well as all the discussions and rants concentrated will have a much better chance of reaching the people who might do something.
7. This one isn't really a point, but more like a suggestion along the lines I myself follow. If it's something specific or a bug in the new UI that annoys you, check the Chromium project if there are any issue open about it and see when they'll fix it, or file one yourself so that the new UI might become what you need it to be.

We're all in the same situation here, a lot of us hate things about the new UI, but that doesn't mean the sub should be clogged with repeated posts that have nothing new to add.

Chrome 71 apparently fixes an arbitrary code execution bug in sqlite.  That's a serious security issue; the worst case for such a bug is machine takeover by malware.  Do you want your machine taken over by malware?  Just so you can have UI you currently like a bit better?

&#x200B;

DO NOT, EVER, FOR ANY REASON, RUN A NON-UPDATING BUILD OF CHROME.  As a Chrome developer, I would \_far\_ rather you use another browser instead.  Or adapt to our current UI, or install a theme, or stop using the web entirely; frankly, ANY other choice, as long as any browser you use updates.  It's not just about keeping your machine safe.

Chrome,My extension G.lux (the F.lux alternative for Chrome and ChromeOS) just received a major update to version 3.0!,"[G.lux on the Chrome Web Store (free!)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glux/hinolicfmhnjadpggledmhnffommefaf?hl=en)

G.lux changes the color temperature of your webpages for easier viewing in low lighting. Based on the idea of the standalone app called [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/), G.lux is an alternative for those who are unable to install F.lux due to their operating system or administrator access settings, such as schools and workplaces. In addition, G.lux is currently the only F.lux alternative for millions of ChromeOS users worldwide.

**Why would I want to change the color temperature of my webpages?**

Modern displays are 'daylight balanced' causing your brain to think it's daytime, which can keep you from falling asleep at night. In the evening, our eyes naturally expect a more orangish 'tungsten balance.' G.lux is also a useful companion for multitasking photo editors, movie watchers and anyone looking to dim solely their browser without the rest of their desktop applications.

Features:

* New in 3.0! (Most popular user suggestion) Select a time of day to activate automatically! Set the activation time to your local sunset for an optimal circadian rhythm!
* Change the color temperature of your browser/websites.
* Make your websites darker without using the monitor or operating system display settings.
* Choose a custom color for your webpages. You can even make your screen pink or green!
* Variable filter intensity: One-extension for all screens and brightnesses!
* Save color and intensity settings across multiple Chrome browsers or ChromeOS devices.

Tips:

* Use a black filter with a low intensity to create a dimmed screen between the 'screen off' position and the lowest brightness settings on your monitor. Sometimes the lowest setting just isn't dim enough!
* Select a dark theme for Chrome. This extension only changes the color temperature of the page(s) you’re viewing and not the omnibar/tabs at the top of the browser. Alternatively, you may wish to use Chrome in Full-screen mode (F11).

Other changes in 3.0:

* Dropdown color list has been changed to a much better box-like interface.
* Custom color selection is now tolerable.
* Rebranded to American spelling of the word ‘color’ because of programming and marketing convention.﻿"

Chrome,"Is it just me, or does Google need to quit trying to expand Chrome's functionality and focus back on making a web browser that actually lets me browse the web?","I think I've officially quit using Chrome one a month for the past two years. The problems started as just small nuances, but are now getting to the point where I can't even use Chrome for its core purpose. You spend any time on their support forums and find it riddled with issues. The biggest seem to stem from flash, but so many are core issues.

I realize I have no idea how Google allocates its development time, but I feel like they need to shift their efforts, focusing more on just ensuring their browser actually performs its core function, viewing web content!

The problem is, all that time spent on features is what's made it such an amazing browser. So for me, trying to switch browsers has become almost as much hassle. For the most part I still use Chrome as my primary browser, but I'm finding I need to use FF and even IE more and more to compensate.

Am I alone in this, or do others feel the same?


**[Edit 1]** Most people are asking about the issues I have, so here's the gist of it.

Flash has always been the most prominent, but that alone is too much IMO. I've disabled the pepflashplayer which fixes 90% of the issues, but anything that requires flash I'm forced to use FF. It might not sound like such a big deal, but I use YouTube quite frequently (viewing and managing my videos), so having to switch to FF constantly is very frustrating and time consuming. Which btw...how does Google produce a browser that can't play it's own videos?

Constant issues with pinned tabs not loading on startup. 

* Pinned tabs need to be static and difficult to remove. You should not be able to change the site that's 'pinned' without closing the tab. 
* Links click from Pinned tabs should override your preferences and open in a new tab. 
* If you have a window with pinned tabs, open a 2nd window, then close your tabbed window first...POOF! You lose your pinned tabs next time you open Chrome.

I still get, what I'll call 'tab ghosting' quite frequently. It's when you click on another tab but the previous tab's content is still displayed, so you have to refresh the page. Try writing out a half-page reply in a forum only to rewrite it half a dozen times.

Most recently after the update yesterday, it basically shut down all ability to use it. I did find a workaround by disabling GPU and threaded compositing. However, it doesn't work on all pages and I get constant ghosting.

I just noticed the Live Preview from the enhanced reddit suite extension is not updating (i.e. not live).

Other than that, I mean there's been issues for me with almost every significant update. Fixes range from disabling this plugin or that extension or waiting until the next update. At least twice I've had to quit using Chrome for at least 2-3 weeks until there was a fix. The odd part is I have 4 computers at home and my one at work. Chrome works perfectly on three of them (my 2 HTPCs and spare laptop) but my primary desktop and work PC both have constant issues, which are the two use almost exclusively :(

**[EDIT 2]** Thanks for all the feedback everyone! (I'm actually surprised at how few people here have issues considering the all the crap I've dealt with in the last year or more.)

I'd also like to thank everyone for your support help. To clarify, here are several of the steps I've tried in the past along with some other basic info. I'll gladly accept any suggestions and try about anything though! I haven't reinstalled Chrome yet since yesterday's issues began though, so I'll do that now.

* OS: All desktop PCs running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, Laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit
* Extensions: Checker Plus for Gmail, Google Voice, Group Reddit Saved Links, IBA Opt-out, LastPass, Reddit Enhancement Suite and Xmarks.
* Have done a clean uninstall/reinstall multiple times over the years with no luck. I first erased all my browser saved data, I always use Revo for uninstalling and deleted all profile folders.
* The issues have even came about after a clean install of Windows; however, I know the last time I reinstalled windows on my home desktop, I did not have issues for at least the first few days, if not a week or two even with all extensions being used. My guess is it began acting up again after an update."

Chrome,How to disable tab groups (but unfortunately not tab grid) that works on Chrome 91.0.4472.88,"It's possible this has been posted before in the comments on one of the other threads but I didn't see it and figured since tab groups has pissed off a lot of people hopefully it'll make someones day a little bit better.

As far as I can tell there's no way to disable grid layout anymore, but I just did this on my 4XL and it has successfully disabled tab groups and it appears to stick after a couple of reboots and force quitting chrome. So that's something I guess..

Anyways, lets get to it.

1. Navigate to chrome://flags and do a reset all first if you've previously messed with the flags. I had to do this myself to get everything working.  

Restart chrome after resetting flags before continuing.  

And use the search bar to find and disable the following, in order:

2. Tab Grids Layout: Disabled (Click Relaunch Prompt)

3. Tab Groups Continuation: Disabled (Click Relaunch Prompt)

4. Temporarily unexpire M89 flags: Disabled (Click Relaunch Prompt)

5. Temporarily unexpire M90 flags: Disabled (Click Relaunch Prompt) (This will allow the following three flags to be visible).

6. Tab Groups: Disabled (Click Relaunch Prompt)

7. Tab Groups UI Improvements: Disabled (Click Relaunch Prompt)

8. Conditional Tab Strip: Disabled (Click Relaunch Prompt)

9. You're done! Tab groups should now be disabled (at least for the time being).

I found this solution at the bottom of this article that appears to be updated with a workaround every time it's needed.

Edit sept 8.: So this doesn't work anymore. But if you go to chrome://flags and reset all it looks like Chrome 93 has added both a open in new tab and open in new tab group button.

The extension is now [not on the Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/daoidaoebhfcgccdpgjjcbdginkofmfe?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) but was still active & enabled on Chrome.

So, if you're using it, I would advise you to disable it.

Chrome,How do I disable grouped tabs in Chrome Mobile,They just appeared this morning and I have spent 2 hours trying to disable them and I am at my wits end.  I disabled them in Chrome://flags and have tried every solution I could find to no avail. I cannot even find an email or phone number for Google support.
Chrome,Chrome is increasingly making it difficult to disable tab groups with every update. Here are the chrome://flags you have to disable to disable tabs. It works now but it might be messed with again on the next update.,
Chrome,"The new Tab Search has been enabled, how long until we can't disable it?","Just like the current user icon, to manage the logged in user on our chrome browser, we have a new search tabs button showing up. And just like the last time, they slap it in right next to the minimize button, instead of letting it be optional from the start in the hamburger menu or next to the other extension icons.

Chrome, seriously? We complained last time too. LEARN THIS LESSON. You are disrupting UI workflow with these pointless attempts to provide more accessibility for the ultra users. I do not NEED to search my tabs. I do not have that many tabs open to need to search. I do not NEED to change or manage my logged in user because I do not USE more than ONE user. By enabling these things as a default, rather than just directing people to a new feature to enable, you are creating workflow problems for the casual user.


**For anyone googling, like me, to find the solution to this new and forced problem from Google Chrome's inept dev department?**


**chrome://flags/#enable-tab-search**


**put that in your browser url, hit enter, set from default to disabled**. 


Found on exactly ONE website https://knowtechie.com/chrome-finally-has-tab-search-on-desktop-heres-how-to-enable-and-use-it/ and that's oriented towards enabling the feature before it was pushed as a default.

GET IT TOGETHER CHROME. I'm tired of waking up to find yet another UI workflow breaking feature being pushed as default. I'm tired of spending time out of my day searching for ways to disable it. I'm tired of reading the praise by people for a feature that I never asked for, wanted, or needed.

All web browsers suck. Chrome sucked slightly less. These days? I'm rethinking that. Stop breaking my UI. And NEVER take away the ability to disable these features, or at the very least allow us to choose where they show up. I don't need more clutter. I don't need less choice. I don't need you to decide how my UI should go. And stop bugging me about grouping tabs."

Chrome,"Thanks to Chrome, I've now switched to Opera :/","This may be controversial posted here, but it needs to be said. For the last several months, my quad-core, 16GB RAM computer has been completely grinding to a halt, to the point where it would be come completely unusable for 10+ minutes at a time and I'd have to use the Windows task manager to force kill the offending program. Well, over and over every single time, it was Chrome that was causing the issue. So, I decided several weeks ago to try some alternatives. I tried Vivaldi, Firefox, and Opera. The difference was staggering. I've been living with Opera now since that time & my computer runs like a dream. I just switched back to Chrome for a test and found that with 13 tabs open, Chrome used about 4GB RAM and over 50% of my CPU! Ouch! In comparison, Opera is using 2.7GB RAM & 1-3% CPU with 140+ tabs! More than 10x the number open in Chrome.

Chrome,Dear Chrome extension Devs please port your extensions to Firefox. It takes 3 minutes for most of them. Here is how!,"Hi all,

I know Firefox is not your browser of choice but recently Firefox has been [reimplementing Chrome's extension APIs](http://arewewebextensionsyet.com/). This makes porting Chrome extensions trivial. [I ported some of them](https://my.owndrive.com/index.php/s/aYxdp4X0KVmgxEg) but did not publish them since I am not the original author.

How to port:

1) Install [Chrome store foxified](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chrome-store-foxified/) in a Firefox instance. Preferably in [Firefox DevEdition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).

2) Sign up for [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/).

3) Visit your extension's [home page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fearch/kalmlbhhgndofalfencmggfncedfajgj) in the Firefox.

4) [Add to Firefox](https://youtu.be/xjcFxH8enoU?t=132) & sign addon. Done.

You might find useful the [Browser support for the APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs) and the [Chrome incompatibilities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#Chrome_incompatibilities_2).

If you wish to debug it in Firefox just visit about:debugging in Firefox and load your extension from file. You need to pick manifest.json file in the file picker.

If you do not pass the Mozilla code review or do not want to publish your addon on [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/) no problem: you can distribute them on your own web sites as an [unlisted addon](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/12/01/de-coupling-reviews-from-signing-unlisted-add-ons/) (Lastpass does this). You will need to sign your extension with [web-ext sign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Signing_your_WebExtension_for_distribution). The credentials for web-ext sign can be [generated here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/).

[How many Chrome Extensions run in Firefox?](http://mckay.pub/2016-11-18-webextensions/)

Thank you!

PS: if you convert your extension due to this sub post, please comment a link to the new extension :D

PPS: [Firefox will stop supporting non-WebExtenison from Novermber 2017 onwards and will only allow uploading WebExtensions starting April 2017 to addons.mozilla.org ](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/)"

To those who will suffer this problem in future, open chrome://flags and disable these

>Omnibox UI Hide Steady-State URL Scheme

>Omnibox UI Hide Steady-State URL Trivial Subdomains

then highlight the 192.168.1.1 entry in the address bar's suggestion list, do a SHIFT+DELETE to delete the entry. Next time when you enter the IP address, it will use the HTTP version.

Chrome,Firefox and Edge add support for Google's WebP image format | ZDNet,
Chrome,Google Chrome is getting a full-scale Material Design 2 revamp on its birthday,
Chrome,Chrome 57 is here!,"Hey Redditors,

Sorry for the delay. The Chrome 57 update is in full rollout and you should see the update on your device in the next week or so. Here’s a list of some of the changes we have coming in this release:



**Desktop:**


**Additional “Payment not secure” or “Login not secure” warning on insecure forms**


You may remember in our update in [Chrome 56](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/5ro7kc/chrome_56_is_rolling_out/) that we updated Chrome’s address bar (omnibox) to warn you when visiting an insecure website that asks you to fill out a password or credit card form. We’ve made an additional update to keep you safe and informed by adding a “not secure” message that will display directly in the form when filling it out to let you know your sensitive data (i.e. passwords, credit card info, etc.) could potentially be stolen by attackers. If you run into this issue when visiting a site, try inserting an ""S"" at the end of “HTTP” in the URL (see [help center article](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95617) for more info), or try reaching out to the developer of the site and encourage them to update to the more secure HTTPS to keep your information safer. This update will also be available in Chrome for Android.


**Removal of chrome://plugins page**


The Chrome plugins page used to be the one stop shop for managing plugin settings within Chrome. But as the web has continued to evolve, you may have noticed there have been fewer plugins to manage over time. In this update, the team has decided to remove this page but we’ve found new homes for remaining plugins under Chrome’s Content Settings which can be easily accessed at chrome://settings/content.

-“Chrome PDF viewer” options have moved under Privacy > Content settings > PDF documents

-“Adobe Flash Player” options have moved under Privacy > Content settings > Flash 

-“Widevine Content Decryption Module” (which enables Widevine licenses for playback of HTML audio/video content) can be adjusted under Privacy > Content settings > Protected Content



**Android:**


**New actions in Chrome Custom Tabs**


In this recent update, you’ll notice some of your favorite apps will show the same actions as Chrome in the overflow (three dot) menu powered by Chrome. You'll be able to bookmark, download, search inside the page and more. Try this new feature out in a number of Android apps like Gmail or G+.


**Maximizing full screen mode**


We watch a lot of media on our (sometimes small) phone screens. We’ve made a small but mighty change in this update to make watching videos better. We noticed that most of you turn your phone to maximize the use of the screen when watching videos (i.e. watching landscape videos in landscape and vertical videos in portrait.) In Chrome 57, when you tap on fullscreen, we will detect if the video is tall or wide and automatically rotate it to the right mode so you no longer have to mess around with the auto-rotate toggle. 


**The Physical Web now in your omnibox! (Also available for Chrome for iOS)**


If you’re standing near something with physical web capabilities (such as a vending machine, poster, bus stop, rental car, etc. containing a bluetooth beacon), you can now instantly access relevant information just a tap away within Chrome’s omnibox (address bar).  Just tap on the address bar and websites related to nearby objects will appear.  If you start typing the name of a physical web object, the nearest object will display in the address bar search results. More information on how to enable the Physical Web is on our [help center](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6239299?vid=0-176897555082-1487370769571).



**iOS:**


**“Reading List” is now available for Chrome in iOS:**


You can now add articles that you’re interested in reading but want to check out later in Chrome for iOS’ “Reading List.” You can even read your saved articles even when you’re not connected to the internet! Note that article saving and offline reading has been available in Chrome for Android since Chrome 55.

-To add an article to “Reading List”: Visit the site (when connected to the internet) > tap the “more” menu (three dot icon) > tap the share icon (box with an up arrow) > tap “Read Later”

-To view an article you’ve added to your Reading List:  Tap the “more” menu (three dot icon) > tap “Reading List.”

-To delete an article you’ve added to your Reading List: Tap the “more” menu (three dot icon) > tap “Reading List.” > tap “Edit” > tap the article(s) you’d like to delete > tap “Delete”

-To add an article to Chrome for iOS’ “Reading List” from other iOS apps: Visit the site (when connected to the internet) > tap the share icon (box with an up arrow) > find the Chrome icon in the second row of options > tap “Read Later” 

-If you don’t see the Chrome icon, you may need to swipe all the way to the right > tap “more” > find “Chrome” and toggle the switch to on.


**Pre-populated sites on the new tab page**


If you’re a new user or signed out user of Chrome, you may have noticed in the past that the new tab page is blank. In this latest update, we’ll now be helping you discover popular websites in your area. As you continue to use Chrome, you’ll see these pages change overtime to be more personalized based on your browsing habits.



If you have any questions or feedback about the features above, please let us know!

Chrome,"Why does Google ""fix"" things that aren't broken with ""updates"" that remove perfectly-functional features?","I was very happily using the accessibility setting for simplified tabs (the horizontal list for open tabs) in Chrome browser ever since discovering it existed. It was a far-more-efficient way to navigate through open pages. I was able to quickly and easily jump to any of the 20 or more tabs I have open at any given time without needing to flip through them like a poorly-animated digital Rolodex from the 1960s, trying to spot the one I'm looking for like a sniper trying to spot a target in a crowded outdoor marketplace, or like I'm digging though a haystack made of needles looking for one particular needle.

But somehow, even though I have automatic updates TOTALLY DISABLED in Google Play Store, Chrome apparently UPDATED ITSELF ANYWAY to the current version (as of Jan 6th), and I lost this functionality!

I then tried uninstalling all Chrome updates on my phone, and it's STILL GONE!

I even tried searching chrome://flags as an article I found said you can enable the tabs list accessibility setting from there, and the flag settings they gave aren't available anymore either!

Nothing irks me more with tech than when a developer carelessly removes a perfectly-functioning feature for apparently no reason at all - ESPECIALLY when that feature is an accessibility-related one.

People are reliant on these things to work as they've gotten used to using them working. When a developer wrecks something you were happily using for quite some time, and isn't even available for feedback - let alone responsive to it - it really reinforces how little the end user matters to them. :(

I'm now on the hunt for a secure, open-source, user/community-developed-and-supported Android OS web browser: one that allows the user much more control over its features and UI than Chrome ever has (or apparently ever will). If anyone knows of any that fit this description, please do tell!

For comparison: if you're familiar with the Telegram chat app, imagine this browser being what Telegram is in terms of privacy, user-friendliness, customizability, cloud storage, and features when contrasted with something like Google Hangouts. I need to find the Telegram of Android web browsers, and ditch using Chrome once and for all... or as much as possible since, for desktop access to certain Google services/functionality (like Google Photos or Drive), you're forced to use Chrome."

I downloaded the extension ""Personal Blocklist"" to stop Pinterest from appearing on the web search, and it works, but it doesn't work for image search. I don't want to have to keep doing -site:pinterest for every image search I do. Is there something that either adds that to every search I do by default, or just automatically blocks images from Pinterest in the results?"

Chrome,Why is Chrome choking as soon a gifs appear?,"Sometimes it can't even handle one gif if it is above 3mbs in size without freezing up scrolling and loading at an abysmal rate. Multiple ones are even worse.

So why is this? How does Google fuck up something like this? It's a pretty embarrassing issue to have, I mean more than 1 gif completely lagging up their browser in 2015.

Chrome,An easier method to copy/export your Chrome Android tabs from into a note or text file!,"# THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE

This doesn't work anymore, because Google removed the Share Tabs option. However, see this comment for an alternative solution: https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/n6k7yt/-/hyqr10h

**Please stop commenting saying it's not working for you. I know it is not working for you because it is not working for anybody. Google removed the incredibly useful Share Group feature which completely effed this method.**

# The Method (WHICH DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE)

If you've ever wanted to copy your open Chrome Android tabs (may work on iOS too but not tested), now's the time. It's very simple, but may take a few minutes depending how many tabs you've got.

We'll be taking advantage of tab groups. If you don't have them enabled, there is a flag for it - have a quick gander at Google to find it. If you already have groups of your tabs, follow the instructions in the second section. Otherwise, follow from step 1 below to group your tabs up.

Hopefully this helps - I discovered this feature by accident a while ago and just remembered how to do it again

# Section 0 - Flags

Go to `chrome://flags` in the browser, search for ""Tab Groups Continuation"", and Enable it. Restart Chrome fully by closing it from your recent apps and relaunching.

`chrome://flags/#enable-tab-groups-continuation`

*This* is what enables the three-dot menu.

# Section 1 - Creating Groups

Step 1 -- Group your tabs: Go into the tab switcher, click the three dots, and click Group Tabs
Step 2 -- [Select all your tabs](https://i.imgur.com/TZKqfnx.png) and click Group

# Section 2 - Export

You need to repeat the below steps for each tab group.

Step 1 -- Select a tab group, tap the three-dot menu, and click [Share group](https://i.imgur.com/4ndBpCI.png)

Step 2 -- In the Share menu, select Keep Notes or another similar app of your choice. As long as you can edit text in it you should be fine

Step 3 -- Tidy the list (if you're picky like me). The original list layout is a bit shite

# Step 4 -- Don't Forget, THIS DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE. See the top of the post."

Chrome,Alternatives to Workona Tab Manager,"Started using Workona a few months ago and it became an integral part of my workflow.
