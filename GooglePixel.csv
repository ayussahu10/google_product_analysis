GooglePixel,Pixel prevented me from calling 911,"I had to call an ambulance for the grandmother on Friday as she appeared to be having a stroke. I got off a phone call with my mom, and proceeded to dial 911 just by typing and calling on my pixel. My phone got stuck immediately after one ring and I was unable to do anything other than click through apps with an emergency phone call running in the background. This is all while the phone informed me that it had sent my location to emergency services. Sadly I couldn't tell the person on the other end what apartment I was in, or what the actual emergency was as I was unable to speak to a human.

As my phone had clearly just been working from a phone call perspective, my best guess is the extra step of trying to send my location caused it to freeze. It then prevented me from hanging up and trying to call any phone number again. Luckily my grandmother is of the generation that still has a land line, otherwise I would have had to restart my phone, wait for a reboot, and then attempt to call emergency services so they could get people over asap. I'll let you know from experience that the last thing you want to go wrong during an actual emergency is your phone to mess up. Especially when time is of the essence, and the faster you get emergency services to your door, the more likely it is that you will survive.

I'm hoping that someone from Google can let me know that you're solving for this problem. Cause let's be real, as someone without a landline, I sure as hell don't want a phone that freaks out when I try to call 911 in the middle of a life threatening emergency. I'm supposed to trust that a phone will do the main thing is built for, and place the call, and let me speak to the human on the other end.

-----UPDATE-----
Tried calling again to see if the bug persists, and it does. I filmed it with my partners phone, and am happy to share. Going on 5 minutes and no response from emergency vehicles and no evidence that 911 was called from a phone log perspective. Checked my Verizon phone log and can see all other calls from today and Friday, but no evidence Verizon knew I was trying to call 911.

This is blowing up - wanted to clarify that I had been able get through on other calls the whole time and the 911 call was the only one that hasn't worked or been recorded on either my phone call log or my Verizon call log. I also contacted Google already, but haven't heard back. Also shout-out to whoever pointed me to the FCC as I'm filing the too. 

Google Support reached out to me through here - Thanks for the upvotes and the visibility ❤️ I've sent over a debugging report after replicating the issue. Hopefully their teams can figure out the issue.

-----------my response to how Google handled this--------

Hey! I wanted to give Google some time after posting their response in this thread and separately on Reddit before posting the below but at this point no one from Google has reached out to me to let me know 1) that there was a bug confirmed and it wasn't just my phone, or 2) how to fix it. Thank goodness Reddit peeps tagged me in things to make sure I was aware that there was a response and a fix for it. You would think with a bug this big Google would have at least responded in our email thread we have going to inform me how to fix it. Actually I would have expected Google to go out of their way and send a push to all Android devices with teams installed to inform their consumers of the possible issue.

You know it's amazing how a phone can bring feelings of safety, and how shockingly unsafe one feels when they know their phone is royally effed. The world is a tad bit scary when you're a woman alone walking your dog at night after a day in the hospital. Especially when you're a woman walking their dog alone at night who can hear gun shots a few streets down and is acutely aware of her  inability to call 911 for help. Be it for her own safety or for someone else's. 

People shouldn't have to wait for this story to make headlines to find out they need to resolve an issue of this magnitude, especially not the person who brought the bug to your attention in the first place. You have the ability to push a notification that informs us our software is out of date, which means you have the ability (and in my opinion the responsibility) to inform us that our life line to emergency services is potentially flawed due to a gap in YOUR software. This issue is bigger than bad press or your bottom line and you should be acting accordingly. 

I guess I shouldn't presume that the tag line ""do no evil"" means you inherently ""do good"" cause apparently you just don't ""do"" anything at all when it matters. Consider my lesson learnt.

----------------------- Other people ------------------------
Several other people have messaged me about running into the same issue, including one person today - a few days after Google acknowledged the issue, and a day after Microsoft acknowledged the issue. As this is a known issue actively impacting people after both parties took partial responsibility and both acknowledged the issue, does it make sense to reach out to a lawyer?


Phone: Pixel 3
OS: Android 11
Service: Verizon"
GooglePixel,MKBHD: “My Pixel 6 Pro has slowly gotten so buggy since launch in October that I can no longer recommend it at $900. Combined with the latest botched update it's just been a bad experience. My SIM is back in an S21 Ultra til the next review.”,
GooglePixel,"Google: To give users peace of mind, every Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will now come with a 2-year warranty worldwide",
GooglePixel,Project Soli: What was promised vs What was delivered,
GooglePixel,This community needs a reality check,"The RAM management issues on the Pixel 3 are quite serious, and many people are having issues. Someone here had their navigation randomly switched off, and many bloggers / tech journalists have pointed out that apps randomly shut down due to this issue. It may be battery optimization or RAM optimization or whatever. The point is, I do not care what the excuse is and neither should anybody else. The problem is, that part of this community is so far up Google's arse that some urgent issues get down voted into an oblivion.

If you are paying so much money for a device, the damn thing should JUST WORK! I am a huge Google fan boy, but their incoherent and ridiculous strategy of pricing like iPhone but giving totally mediocre after care is really starting to piss me off, and it should piss all of you off as well. As fanboys, it is okay to say that Pixels take the best photos. It is okay to say you get pure android. But it is NOT okay to accept mediocre. It is NOT okay to pay upward of USD 1000 for a device and be Google's beta tester.

I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage during one of the iPhone events more than 7 years ago, and getting huge applause when he said - 'It just works'. Unfortunately we cannot say that about any of Googles mobile offerings. Messaging is an incoherent mess more than a few years after iMessage, the Nexus 5x turned out to be a sham, and Pixel is slowly headed there with the completely brain dead decision to put a hideous notch, and now this lack of software optimization. Heck, my current $200 Huawei Honor 6x (which many of you may not even have heard of) with 4 GB RAM and a Snapdragon 625 SoC handles multitasking like a champ, so there is absolutely no excuse for a device that costs 5 times more (and possibly has 5 times better benchmarks) to get basic things wrong.

TL;DR - stop mindlessly defending Google

Edit: this post has garnered way more attention than I expected. The fact that it has been reported several times literally proves the point I am trying to make. In any case, there have been a few productive discussions, and I think everyone can agree on the following:

- Let's report problems to Google via the feedback option on phones. There a separate thread. Not sure if linking is allowed.
- some people have had no problems, and that is great. Hopefully there will be fewer problems going ahead.
- let's be nicer to people facing issues rather than down voting because we do not agree that the issue is significant enough. 
- work arounds are nice. Fixes and patches by Google are better. "
GooglePixel,My brother lost his Pixel 4 while skiing yesterday. Today he found it under 20cm of snow.,
GooglePixel,I sent my phone to google in August to get replaced and have had the worst customer service experience of my life since.,"Im August my Google Pixel 1 stopped working. It would not turn on past the startup screen so I contacted google and they offered to replace it. I sent it to google returns in Grapevine, TX using the return label they sent me, and according to the tracking number it was delivered on August 24th. I was told it would take 7-14 days to replace it. But after 3 weeks I had not received my phone or heard anything from google. I tried contacting them and was told that they never received it even though the tracking number says it was received and signed for.  They said I would receive any updates as they come, but to no surprise there has not been a single update.  I have tried getting this problem solved through support chat, calling, and the pixel forum but nothing has helped make any progress in getting my phone. It seems like they must have lost it to me, but it’s been upwards of 3 months and I’d really just like to have my old phone back. Is there anything I can do to fix this?
[Google claiming they never received it and tracking info](https://imgur.com/a/82Ojrka)"
GooglePixel,I just discovered this cool Google Pixel 4 easteregg using Google Lens.,
GooglePixel,FYI: Buying a Pixel has an Arbitration Agreement,"I'm not sure if people are aware of this since I didn't really see anyone else mention this but it seems that as a condition of buying a Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL you agree to a binding arbitration agreement (you agree to waive your right to a class action lawsuit and instead say that you'll use arbitration to settle disputes) if you purchase and do not return your Pixel within 30 days of activation if you do not opt out of said agreement. This kind of rubbed me the wrong way even though I know it's now just becoming standard to include these agreements in the terms of service for many things.

You can opt out of the agreement pretty easily, however, by using g.co/pixel/optout. Make sure that you do it in the 30 days though. Just letting people know in case they weren't aware. I'm loving my Pixel 3 XL otherwise.

Edit: Here are the pictures of said agreement: http://imgur.com/a/SA4ovsi

Edit 2: Someone else mentioned that the agreement is also in the set up process.

Edit 3: If you're not in the US this agreement probably doesn't apply to you.

Tl;dr: you give up your right to sue if you don't return your Pixel in 30 days **or** opt out at g.co/pixel/optout"
GooglePixel,Thought y’all’d appreciate this,
GooglePixel,I finally figured out why my alarm kept turning off...,"For the past few months, I could not figure out why on random days, with seemingly no reason, sometimes my alarm would either not go off, or turn itself off very quickly. Maybe once every other week or so, I would wake up 30 minutes later on my backup alarm, with no indication as to why the first shut itself off.

Well this morning, I woke up about 5 minutes before my alarm went off, and I have cracked the code.

The alarm is set to play a Spotify playlist, and one of the songs on that playlist is ""Where is My Mind"" by the Pixies. If you know the first line of that song, you may know where I'm going with this...

The first line in the song is ""Ooohhh STOP"", with the word ""stop"" said very clearly. My Pixel has been hearing that ""stop"" and turning the alarm off. Since it's a playlist on shuffle, it only comes up every once in a while, so it's not happening every morning. 

Glad that feature works..."
GooglePixel,Does it look like smooth display is turning off when under 50% brightness to anyone?,"Update: We did it! Google announced they will be releasing an update to enable smooth display in more brightness conditions

GooglePixel,Google Warranty Is a SCAM! Never buying a Google Phone again,"**NOTE: Please see updates at the bottom**  
**NOTE: Final Update 12/14/2022 will be found at the bottom of the post**

I purchased a Google Pixel 5a back in April. As you can see in the linked screenshot, the warranty is still good until next year:

[https://imgur.com/zUovKxP](https://imgur.com/zUovKxP)

However, last month the screen inexplicably died. No drops, and no damage to the phone. See the phones condition in the below images:

[https://imgur.com/skrIRZX](https://imgur.com/skrIRZX)

[https://imgur.com/rdRfIuw](https://imgur.com/rdRfIuw)

I reached out to Google to file a warranty claim, and their response was as follows:

*""Thank you for contacting Google Support.*

*We’ve carefully reviewed your case and have determined that this device is not eligible for a warranty replacement. You can contact one of our trusted repair partners, who may be able to fix this issue for an additional fee.*

I replied as follows:

At this point I was beyond frustrated, so I called Google and demanded an explanation.  The manager said he would get back to me, and he did so with this email:

*""Hi Tyler,* 

*Thank you for your patience.* 

*I understand your concern. As promised we have checked with our specialist team. As per the update, the device is not eligible for a warranty and there is nothing we can do about it.*

I am not sure how Google is able to get away with this, but I am talking with an attorney to see what my options are for getting my money back.  I have a $500 paper weight sitting on my desk.

**Updates:**

I wanted to provide a couple of updates based on some of the comments.

* The phone was not purchased by Google, but through mint mobile.  Mint is pawning the issue to Google, as they state that their warranty is straight from the manufacture.  Their RMA page did not work, and this is the response I got from them when reaching out to the support:[https://imgur.com/lCnqZJT](https://imgur.com/lCnqZJT)
* Regardless, Google should honor the warranty when bought through a third party reseller, as stated clearly on their website:[https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer](https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer)[https://imgur.com/1JZKlrL](https://imgur.com/1JZKlrL)
* Some have suggested that I go into a uBreakFix and have them deal with it.  I tried that already, they sent me away saying I need a warranty claim number from Google for them to work on it.
* No the phone was NOT damaged
* Even if the warranty was not valid for some reason, Google should at least give an explanation for why, not jus this BS answer of ""its not eligible, because its not eligible""
* Because no modern day human can go without a cellphone, I had to go buy a new phone in the meantime.  I went with a OnePlus and have been very pleased with it, for far less money than the Google Pixel.  So at this point a replacement would be nothing but a waste of my life, as I would have to sell it to get my money back.  The hours of my life that are lost are a separate issue, which also has me bitter over this entire experience.
* To those accusing me of lying about talking to Google on the phone, there IS an option for them to call you when chatting with support.  Check your facts before making accusations:[https://imgur.com/Q2jvTh2](https://imgur.com/Q2jvTh2)

**Final Update 12/14/2022:**

Thanks to the help of u/dmziggy I finally got a replacement from Google.  However I am still stuck because I had to buy a new phone in the meantime, so its still a loss for me.  I am going to sell the phone, but I won't get back what I paid.  Because of this, I will be leaving this post up as a mar on Google's reputation which is well deserved. "

Apparently the wonderful people at FedEx decided that they needed my Pixel more than I did. The tape on the bottom of the brown box was cut and replaced, and the white ""Pixel"" box inside had had its tape slit as well. All that was inside of that box were the charger and adapter. 

Google's customer service was wonderful though, and a replacement will arrive at my house on Monday or Tuesday.

GooglePixel,"FedEx lost shipment, google won't send me a replacement","FedEx says they delivered my phone but the camera at my house show that they never showed up. While on the phone with FedEx they said it was delivered to a house three blocks away. They were unable to recover the phone after 48 hours and now consider the package ""lost"". It's been a week since FedEx admits they lost the package. The law requires that Google give me either a refund or a new shipping date but they have done neither although I call them every day ([https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0221-billed-merchandise-you-never-received](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0221-billed-merchandise-you-never-received)).

Last time FedEx delivered something to the wrong address (with a $1,000 Sony television) I just stopped payment on my credit card because after two weeks I got fed up with being the intermediary between Sony and FedEx. However, I have learned (and Google confirmed) that if I stop VISA payment I will get blacklisted by Google an all my services will get stopped. I use and pay for many Google services so this would not be good - now I'm reconsidering being so vendor-locked and might start divesting myself from Google after 14 years.

What are my options?

Google, if you see this, WTF!?

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this post to get so much attention, I was really just venting! Some people asked why I didn't use chat so a paper trail would exist so I tried it out for today's attempt: [chat session](https://imgur.com/nvXmZhP). I think the chat is pretty representative of the phone calls I've had. In the chat he asks for me to reply to the email I got from the support team. However, that email thread is nearly all me trying to get updates without a response.

&#x200B;

Update: Google has [responded](https://imgur.com/ScwoF4x) claiming that the order \*was\* delivered (see below). FedEx is now sending me a ""letter of explanation"" proving that they lost the package and that I did not receive it. I have no idea what Google has been doing for the last 7 days or why they couldn't call FedEx and simply ask them if the package was lost or not. Seriously, WTF google!?

`Thanks for contacting us about your order. We’ve carefully reviewed your case and our records confirm that your order was successfully delivered to the address you provided.`

`If the address you provided as the shipping address belongs to a company or a non-residential location, please contact them to track down your package.`

`Unfortunately, we’re unable to replace your order as Google has fulfilled our services by successfully delivering your complete order to the location you provided.` 

`As a next step, you may consider initiating an investigation with the carrier or notify local law enforcement. We’ll be happy to assist in an investigation.`

&#x200B;

Update 2: I spoke with an extremely unhelpful FedEx ""customer advocate"" who was unwilling to state ""yes or no"" if FedEx had lost the package when I asked for a simple written statement and indicated that I should open a claim. After 20 minutes of arguing I ended the call and confirmed that a claim had already been opened last week when I reported the package missing. I called back and a very helpful FedEx employee took over my case and said the computer did indicate that they had lost the package and that she would send all the paperwork they had to me - but it would take 5 to 7 days. I've also sent a reply to Google stating that FedEx admits they lost the package. Am I taking crazy pills? She also mentioned that because the pre-tax value ($999) was under $1000 they didn't need a signature. Also, she said that since Google did not report a value they would only be entitled to $100 from FedEx for the lost shipment.

&#x200B;

Update 3: A community manager from Google has messaged me and now I guess they are looking in to the matter internally. I also gave /u/dmziggy my information, I'm not sure how much someone who doesn't work at google can help but it's worth a shot. At this point FedEx has admitted fault but says that only the shipper can initiate a claim. On the other hand Google is claiming that since the package was delivered it is up to me and local law enforcement to deal with the problem. From my side the disconnect appears to be between Google and FedEx and I don't really understand where my role is in this ridiculous debate.

&#x200B;

Update 4 - REPLACEMENT BEING SHIPPED: A new person has replied to the support email and Google has reversed their decision and will replace the phone with 2nd day air shipping. I'm not sure if the community manager had anything to do with it but I'm assuming this Reddit attention helped push it through - so thanks to everyone who made my post popular. I hope Google learns from my experience so it doesn't happen to anyone else. I still don't know what went on behind the scenes between Google and FedEx but they need to get on the same page when it comes to deliveries. And require a signature by default!"
GooglePixel,Storm warnings.,"So, since the December Update, I'm getting various Storm warnings sent to my phone from all over the world...despite living in the UK...

GooglePixel,Google Permanently banned my account because their system didn't recognize that I returned my phones to them,"NOT RESOLVED: 

Update March 15, 2018: [They re-banned my account](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/84sysx/update_google_permanently_banned_my_account/)


So, I've been on the phone with them all day but they won't budge. 

Basically, I returned my RMAs to Google and they charged my account anyway. I contacted them directly a few times, but they were not processing the return on time (14 days). I had to issue a chargeback/dispute with my card to prevent paying interest and late fees by not paying. 

A few days later, I get an email from Google saying I broke their terms of service and my account has been permanently banned. I've spoken on the phone to the returns dept and they confirmed that they did indeed receive the phones and that they don't see any fraud or issues on the account. One guy even admitted they've been having issues with returns not processing correctly, however, when they send the issue to an account specialist, they come come back and tell me my account will stay banned, forever. They don't give a reason, simply repeating that the terms of service were broken.

I've had this email since almost the days of Gmail beta and been a customer for years. I'm pretty upset I won't be able to use it anymore to make purchases. What's worse is they won't even let me speak to an account specialist who decides these cases directly. 

Edit: To clarify, Google Payments is suspended. App purchases, music, video, gift card balances, buying cloud storage, Youtube Red, Android pay, buying hardware from Google Play. I have a gift card balance that is stuck and I can't use/transfer it. I still have my email, photos etc (thankfully)

Update March 1, 2018: Google unlocked my account after this post got some attention, but is still fighting my credit card dispute. I've sent them and my credit card company tracking and RMA numbers but they are still fighting it. It's such a large company; since this issue has gone to dispute, I doubt different departments speak to each other.

As seen here https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-live-images-exclusive

I decided to contact Android Central to release the images because I figured they would have the most reach. I've been a longtime follower of Android Central and wanted to give them the exclusive. I spoke with the editor-in-chief yesterday morning and they released the article later that day. Now that the bulk of the info is out there I thought I'd open up the floor to some questions...soo here we go!

To answer a few questions right off the bat:

* My buddy is the one that found the watch. He is a bartender at the restaurant it was left at. They held it for a few weeks expecting the people that left it to return, but that never happened. He gave it to me because I'm the tech nerd so he let me deal with it.

* The reason the bands aren't attached in any photos is simple - my buddy forgot to give them to me with the watch. They were packaged separately and he forgot to bring them over, so he sent me pictures of them for the article (notice the background is different). I'll get them from him at some point and post an image of the whole package.

* No charger was left, and the battery is dead. The image with the 'G' boot logo was taken by my buddy the day he found it. It had a small amount of charge at that point but only booted to that screen, guessing there isn't a full OS loaded.

* No, I don't work for Google or any subsidiaries, and nobody is paying me to do this.

GooglePixel,60 features in Android 13 that Pixel users should know about,"Hi /r/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.

Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. 

Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!

Without further ado, here's my list:

1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to ""make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves."" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.

2. [**Resolution switching**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds ""screen resolution"" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)

3. [**Hub mode**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).

4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the ""Colors"" screen saver.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)

5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.

6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.

7. [**Virtualization support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https://blog.esper.io/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 

8. [**exFAT support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https://blog.esper.io/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849/)

9. [**Ambient Context events**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https://9to5google.com/2022/05/26/pixel-android-snore-detection/) about Google adding ""built-in"" snoring/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.

10. [**Cross-device calling**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.

11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).

12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. ""styles."" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https://blog.esper.io/android-12l-deep-dive/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)

13. [**Themed Icons**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the ""themed icons"" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).

14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can/will tweak this, though. [Before](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).

15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 

16. [**Photo Picker**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)

17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)

18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https://blog.esper.io/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)

19. [**Redesigned media player**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.

20. [**New media controls UI**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.

21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new ""active app"" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the ""active app"" list. [Screenshot of the ""active app"" button in the notifications panel.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the ""active app"" list.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)

22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to ""battery saver"" or ""performance"", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)

23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 

24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 

25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https://blog.esper.io/android-12l-deep-dive/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.

26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)

27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable ""control from locked device"" in settings. [Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).

28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The ""Privacy dashboard"" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of ""show 7 days"" option in privacy dashboard.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)

29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.

30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1524484117550796802) 

31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control/) [Demo + sample app.](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1557802529567694848)

32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)

33. [**""Vibrant"" theme is now actually vibrant**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).

34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https://blog.esper.io/android-12l-deep-dive/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)

35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called ""stylus handwriting"". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1555960332970967040)

36. [**File managers can no longer access /Android/data and /Android/obb**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the /Android/obb or /Android/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https://blog.esper.io/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https://blog.esper.io/how-scoped-storage-works/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.

37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis/) [Screenshot of the ""Restricted Setting"" dialog](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)

38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)

39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https://blog.esper.io/how-scoped-storage-works/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.

40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.

41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)

42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new ""follow typing"" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)

43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.

44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.

45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new ""turn screen on"" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)

46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.

47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.

48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.

49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VOBIuEkWNSA/XR0jIcKZXTI/AAAAAAAAJi0/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.

50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by ""Bunsetsu"", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.

51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.

52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directi"
GooglePixel,Who else goes to tap on the home screen weather icon and gets the calendar instead.,There must be only be 1 pixel between the weather and date icons and it's getting infuriating opening the calendar 3 times before tapping just right to bring up the weather.
GooglePixel,My Google Trade-in Nightmare,"Chalk me up as another sucker for Google's trade-in program. I should have known better. I’ve read all the horror stories people have had. I guess I just hoped it had been up and running long enough that the issues would be worked out by now. Plus it just seemed much easier than trying to sell it on my own. Huge mistake.

Here are the detailed logs of my interactions with Google over the last six(!) weeks of trying to get this resolved.

* **3/18/18** – I purchased a Pixel 2 XL 64GB and initiated a trade-in for my old Pixel XL 32GB. The offer stated that I would receive a refund of **$288.00** to my Synchrony account as long as it powered on, had no cracks in the screen, and had been factory reset. The phone was in mint condition. I had never used it without a case or screen protector and it was literally flawless. Looking back, I should have sold the phone on Swappa. I’m sure I would have gotten a bit more money out of it. I just got caught up in the (supposed) ease of trading it in.
* **3/26/18** – I received the trade-in kit and recorded video of me performing a factory reset, powering off the phone, and sealing it in the box. I made sure to show the phone from all angles to make it clear that there was nothing wrong with it. Then I dropped it off at the post office.
* **3/30/18** – The phone arrived at its destination in Atlanta.
* **4/6/18** – I received a partial refund of **$165.60** with a note claiming “phone doesn’t turn on/off”. I called in to dispute it, spoke with a rep named Zander who assured me it would be resolved shortly. He asked me to submit my video of the phone working and was told I would be updated within 24-48 hours. I emailed him the video while still on the phone with him and he told me he received it. I was assigned case number: **4-5739000021983**.
* **4/10/18** – I emailed Zander back asking for a status update and received no reply.
* **4/13/18** – I emailed Zander again, still no reply.
* **4/17/18** – I contacted Google via web chat and was told the case was still being investigated and that I should hear back from them soon.
* **4/27/18** – I contacted them via web chat again with the same response- it was still being investigated.
* **5/3/18** – I called in to check on the status and spoke with a rep named Christy. She said she would personally help me get this resolved and that she would re-escalate the case to an account specialist since no progress had taken place. She said she would stay in contact and that I would hear back in 3-5 days. I was assigned a new case number: **6-9336000022109**.
* **5/7/18** – Christy emailed me to say that they were still looking into it and that she would keep me updated.
* **5/12/18** – Christy emailed me again to say the same thing, it was still being worked on with no progress.
* **5/18/18** – Christy called me and said the investigation had been concluded. She wouldn’t give me any details about it but said the best they could do is give me a **$50** Google Store credit. I told her I didn’t think that was acceptable as I was supposed to receive an additional refund of **$122.40**, not a credit towards a future purchase. At this point I'll never buy something from them again so the credit is worthless. She put me on hold and came back offering me additional **$30** credit. I didn’t accept that as it still wasn’t what I had been promised and I don’t want to settle. I purchased the phone on the premise that I would receive the full **$288.00** as a refund. She then hung up on me!
* I called back in and was transferred to the Order Management team. I was placed on hold multiple times for 45 minutes without accomplishing anything. This rep seemed really interested in the fact that I had video evidence of the old phone working and he finally offered to let me speak with a supervisor. He claimed the supervisor wasn’t immediately available though and that he would call me back later that day. I never received a call back.
* **5/21/18** – I called in and was transferred to the Order Management Team. I spoke with a rep named Will who said that the case is still open and he promised me he would have a supervisor call me back that day. I told him I just wanted to speak with a supervisor immediately since I didn’t receive a call back last time but he said it wasn’t an option. I reluctantly agreed to wait for a call back. Surprise- I never received a call.

I’m appalled at how horrible Google’s customer service is. I’ve bought several devices from them over the past eight years including a Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, Galaxy Nexus, all the way back to my Nexus One. I hate to say it but this is will be last purchase I make from them. I’ve been nothing by loyal to them and I’m blown away that they continue to treat their customers like this. It’s clear that they just don’t care. They’re too big and individual customers clearly don’t matter to them.

So here I am at a complete loss as to what to do. I feel like my only option is to turn to the community for help. Maybe posting it here will help bring my issue to light and get it resolved. u/PixelCommunity are you out there? Anyone from Google Support? I just want you guys to make this right.

**UPDATE 5/22/18**: Thank you everyone for upvoting this and helping it to gain traction. I never expected this kind of support, but I really appreciate this empathy I've received from this community. It worked! I just received an email from Google Support from a rep named **Jules**. She was extremely apologetic about this situation and has gone ahead to issue the remaining refund. I'm honestly stunned at the moment. It's hard to believe that six long weeks of pushing this have finally paid off. Thank you thank you thank you, to the r/GooglePixel community and to Jules. You guys have made my day!

**UPDATE 5/23/18**: I've also been contacted by a Google employee named Jason who has been awesome. He's gone above and beyond to make sure I'm happy and taken care of. Google, if you're listening, **Jules** and **Jason** are fantastic. They deserve all the credit for resolving this and delivering excellent customer service. Please use them as examples for the rest of your teams. They know how to treat customers and deserve to be praised for their efforts. Thanks again!

**UPDATE 6/15/18:** I never expected to be posting an update like this, but I feel I wouldn't be doing Google justice if I didn't. **Jason** and another employee named **Kyle** put together a care package for me. It was completely unnecessary but incredibly kind of them. They sent me a[ few goodies](https://imgur.com/a/xcbgaAJ), including a Google Home Mini, a fabric case for my P2XL, and pair of Pixel Buds! I'm at a loss. They completely turned this crummy situation into something fantastic. Thank you guys so much!"

GooglePixel,Just reordered the exact same case after one and a half years of use. Look at that coloration.,
GooglePixel,I really miss the little things that Android 12 completely got rid of,"Being able to tap the date to pull up the calendar on the clock widget was something I'd do basically every day, now you have to either assign a completely separate widget for your calendar or go into your apps to open your calendar. Also to show the weather in ""at a glance"" will also show the date even though the date is part of my preferred clock widget, so I have the date displayed twice on my home screen. It sounds small but it's one of those things that feels like a huge step backwards in this new UI. Hopefully Google will clean this up in future updates."

GooglePixel,"PSA: If you're getting a new phone in the coming weeks, remember to transfer accounts on any authentication apps before you wipe the old phone!","I use Google Authenticator for 2FA, and twice now I've forgotten to transfer the account before switching phones. Ultimately, that resulted in either a lot of work to get the 2FA removed on a website, or having to create a whole new account. It was something that I really don't want to go through again. 

Tip: If you have a second device (tablet, phone etc...) that can run the same authenticator app, you can transfer it now to get ahead of things. 

Hopefully this saves at least one person a little bit of heartache."
GooglePixel,My Pixel 3 was perfect...until it wasn't.,
GooglePixel,"My Findings on the Pixel 6 Pro's ""10–120 Hz"" Variable Refresh Rate","One of the main advertised features of the Pixel 6 Pro that sets it apart from the normal Pixel 6 is the Pro phone's high variable refresh rate (VRR). [Specifically](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US), the 6 Pro should be able to lower its refresh rate down to 10 Hz to save battery. The question that many people have had is, ***does this actually happen?***

# Android's Refresh Rate Indicator is not reliable for this

Some people have (mistakenly) used Android's refresh rate indicator within the Developer Options to come to the conclusion that the 6 Pro's variable refresh rate only goes down to 60 Hz, because that's what the indicator shows when the screen is idle. However, Android's refresh rate indicator does not show the OLED panel's lowest operating refresh rate, due in part by how its VRR is implemented. The Pixel 6 Pro's Samsung Display panel has a variable refresh rate mechanism that operates at a much lower level, within the display driver, and not exposed to the Android user-space.

# How its ""VRR"" actually works

Samsung's VRR implementation is not the same as those found in typical gaming monitors which can target any arbitrary refresh rate. The VRR found in Samsung's HOP (""LTPO"") panels still work by switching between discrete refresh rate modes, like older implementations, but the new panels now incorporate a [low frequency drive](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16069/samsung-variable-refresh-rate-display-explained-vrr-note20-ultra) (LFD) mechanism which operates the OLED driving rate at a fraction of the current refresh rate mode. As an example, a 10 Hz driving refresh rate is achievable by operating the panel at 60 Hz but skipping re-drives for 5 out of every 6 refresh intervals if the frames are the same. This is made possible by the OLED's new oxide driving TFTs, which has leakage current low enough to pull this off without significant luminance dips.

# Does the display actually go down to 10 Hz?

**Yes**, with some ""buts"".

To figure this out, I initially set out to use a photodiode attached to an oscilloscope so I could create an FFT chart to find the display's fundamental driving frequencies. Luckily, I found out about a flicker meter called the Radex Lupin which comes with software that shows the oscilloscope and FFT Spectrum chart from meter readings. With this newfound tool, I took readings from several scenarios along with some annotations:

1. [Smooth Display enabled, Screen Idle, Normal Lighting](https://i.imgur.com/hEuq5TH.png)
2. [Smooth Display enabled, Screen Idle, Low Ambient Lighting & Low Screen Brightness](https://i.imgur.com/y3b9Drb.png)
3. [Smooth Display disabled / Battery Saver](https://i.imgur.com/Vce9gHt.png)
4. [Forced 120 Hz / Scrolling](https://i.imgur.com/mizetfO.png)
5. [Always-On Display](https://i.imgur.com/GzDmtN5.png)
6. [Smooth Display enabled, 30fps video playback](https://i.imgur.com/vzTzgC0.png)

[*(gallery)*](https://imgur.com/a/rLvQhYK)

**And from (#1), we finally find some solid proof that there is a 10 Hz fundamental driving frequency in the Pixel 6 Pro display when screen content is idle, despite the Android refresh rate indicator reporting 60 Hz.**

Along with it, we find two other fundamental frequencies at 120 Hz and 360 Hz. The peak at 360 Hz is almost certainly the PWM frequency, and 120 Hz is the fundamental refresh frequency from which the 10 Hz LFD is employed from.

However, as [ex-AnandTech writer Andrei has found out](https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1455577873209864198), **the Pixel 6 Pro disables LFD/10 Hz drive at low ambient light + low brightness**, and I found further proof of it (#2). From (#2), we see that the screen goes no lower than 60 Hz in dark conditions. The reasoning behind this is that screen flickering may be noticeable for dark color tones when dark-adapted at such sparse re-drive periods.

**I also tested if the Always-On Display went down to 10 Hz (#5), and I can confirm that it does**. It's driven at a 120 Hz PWM freq. and a 60 Hz fundamental refresh, employing LFD down to 10 Hz. These are all really low flicker frequencies, and from my eyes, AODs have always been prone to flickering, but it doesn't matter much for such little cursory text. However, I can see how it could be a problem for actual phone usage, and why Samsung & Google disabled 10 Hz LFD for low light+brightness. The better solution here however would be to use a higher PWM frequency in low light, à la iPhone 13 Pro (240 Hz).

People have also wondered if the display would go down to 10 Hz with Smooth Display disabled or Battery Saver enabled, and I found out that it keeps the display static at 60 Hz (#3). Counter-intuitive to saving battery, this is a bit of a lousy oversight by Google, and hopefully it's addressed in a future update. Something interesting that I found is that the 60 Hz display mode is still fundamentally driven at 120 Hz, and it implicitly utilizes LFD to achieve 60 Hz. This is supported by Samsung's listed LFD operating modes (via [Anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16069/samsung-variable-refresh-rate-display-explained-vrr-note20-ultra)), which lists the discrete 60 Hz VRR mode as having divider values relative to 120 Hz rather than 60 Hz. Thanks to this and the oxide TFTs, this is also why we don't see changes in screen color calibration when the display shifts between refresh rates.

Lastly, I wanted to see if there was some granularity to the VRR, so I tested if the VRR would try to match the frame rate of a movie or a video (#6). However, whether I played a 24fps movie on Netflix or a 30fps video on YouTube, the Pixel 6 Pro stayed at a static 60 Hz refresh rate. I'd say that this leaves decent room for battery improvement in the future, especially for those that watch a lot of videos on their phones, if Google ever implements this.

# TL;DR

* Pixel 6 Pro goes down to 10 Hz as expected when idle in normal lighting
* In low ambient light & low brightness for darker content, refresh rate only goes down to 60 Hz
* Pixel 6 Pro PWM frequency is 360 Hz, lowering down to 120 Hz at <20% system brightness
* AOD goes down to 10 Hz as expected
* Battery Saver/Smooth Display disabled does not go down to 10 Hz, stays at 60 Hz
* Watching 24fps/30fps movies/videos does not lower refresh rate down to 24/30 Hz, stays at 60 Hz

GooglePixel,Google sending customers locked phones and charging restock fees for returns,"My wife ordered an Unlocked Pixel 4XL **from the google store**, and when a Verizon SIM card is inserted, it says that the card is not supported and asks her to call Spectrum Wireless to have the phone unlocked.

We have been back and forth with google support for 5 days and we just keep getting the same copy/pasted troubleshooting steps that we have tried several times. Her original SIM card worked in my Pixel 3XL, and her iPhone. However, Google support wasn't going to move until we contacted Verizon, so we did. During a pandemic, she went to the Verizon store and got a new SIM card.

<insert many typical support chat sessions and emails here. 5days!>

After getting a new SIM card from Verizon specifically for the Pixel, and having the same problem, she is still being copy/pasted the same troubleshooting steps 5 days in to ""working with Google Pixel Support""

Considering how bad support has been, she has changed her mind about moving to Android and just wants a refund, and they are saying that there will be a restock fee to return the defective phone that they sent her.

This is Google now.

Please upvote this. I want people to start talking about it. Apparently it has been very common for google to send locked phones to customers who ordered unlocked units, and they have been doing it since December 2019.

Update:

Update again:

The RMA information on the site still says that she will have these fees. A Pixel Rep is telling us that if the fees are charge we can contact him and they will be refunded. I will update when it's all done and let everyone know how that went.

Last update: 

The RMA was completed, and it doesn't appear to have charged her anything. In the end, it worked out, but my wife is still an iPhone user, and I'm not sure I'm not going to follow her lead in a few months when the new phones start dropping.

GooglePixel,[Unpopular opinion..] Can we stop making excuses for Google's poor sub-premium hardware and tech?,"I expect to get fully downvoted for this, it's suicide to do it in a sub dedicated to the brand.

I have a Google Pixel 3 XL, 128GB in the UK. Just so you know where I'm coming from. (Oh also... where's my Call Screen at..?)

It seems almost daily that I see people making excuses for Google's tech, and implementation of said tech. Lots of hardware issues, screens that are inconsistent, flagship premium prices but innovation that doesn't match it.

The software, I can't really bash it, I love stock Android, and I love the suggested freedom this gives you. I also LOVE Google's wizardry when it comes to camera processing, it's at this point the BIGGEST reason why I have the phone. No other phone can match the camera processing that Google has worked hard on -note i'm not saying camera, but the software behind it.

Can we maybe start demanding better? For a 1k+ device we should absolutely have the best technology to rival the other flagship devices out there.

Google can't fall back on the software side forever, sure it's true that really when you get to a certain point in tech (OnePlus flagship, Samsung Flagship) you don't really need to push that but actually then focus on software, but Google isn't at that point yet.

TL;DR: Demand more for your money, there's a certain expectation from hardware when it comes to the word flagship, or premium, and Google isn't there. Yet."

If you are experiencing this, please go to the play store and uninstall Android Webview.  This doesn't fully uninstall webview, it only uninstalls the most recent update. But this will get your phone working normally again.

SOME people have reported their phone works after uninstalling AND then reinstalling Android Webview, but it did not on my wife's phone (4a 5G).  Best to just stick to uninstalling Android Webview.

Hope this helps!"
GooglePixel,This sub has become so rude and disrespectful,"Just saw someone who got their first Pixel asking about a defect (they didn't know it was a defect) in the comments of their post. People downvoted them and rudely told them what it was and how to deal with it. When the person simply showed a sign of being upset about it, they were downvoted and told by another to ""stop whining"" and ""figure it out"". That othrr person was upvoted.

What is wrong with this sub? That is a first time Pixel user asking simple questions and being given such trashy treatment in response. If I were them, I wouldn't have even wanted a replacement if my first phone from a company were defective. Forget the fact that the Pixel community was also trash to them.

Awful.

GooglePixel,Google Store accidentally sent me a case of Pixel 4 phones instead of the one phone I ordered,"I ordered a unlocked Just Black Pixel 4 64GB phone online on sale for $499 plus tax, but much to my surprise I received a case of phones (10 in total) from Fed-Ex two days later. - So 9 extra phones (this is important later). I gotta be honest, for a moment it felt like winning the lottery, but it was only a moment as angel on my shoulder, and my wife, both spoke up, and I knew there was only one choice:

I informed Google customer service, with a little tear in my eye of the mistake over through the chat, and I think they were a little taken aback. At first they requested a photo of the packing slip, and then a picture of the extra phones, which I provided - I informed them that I removed one of the phones - hence the picture had only 9 boxes in it. They ask me to wait 3 separate times, and then sent me an email 2 days later letting me know that Fed-Ex would be stopping by to pick them up. The tracking slip only had a quantity of 8. 

Talk about rubbing salt in the wound, but  I contacted Google customer service again to ask them how to proceed. After more deliberation they told me to return 8 and they would send a tracking slip for the ninth separately.

Edited: The picture
https://imgur.com/a/sgCMJGa
 
Update: The extra 9 phones have been returned to Google, it did take over a week to get the packing slip on the last one, but with Covid-19 I am not surprised. Google did reach out to me via e-mail, thanking me for returning the phones, and gave me $40 credit for the Google store, which is where I bought the phone(s) from, though they didn't have too, and I didn't request it. I appreciate all of your responses on here, even the ones inferring I am stupid for returning them.  Everytime a situation like this occurs everyone wants to know the reason, the person returned the (money, phone etc) they found.  I wish I had a better answer, but it just came down to it was the right thing to do."
GooglePixel,"After six months of dealing with Google Support, they closed my case by incorrectly telling me my warranty has expired.","This is the easiest I've ever gotten out of bed. Woke up to [this](https://imgur.com/YqupSe3) email and was upset enough to come immediately to Reddit. Will likely follow up on Twitter.


Maybe my response wasn't the most appropriate, but it is two days short of six months that they've been giving me the run-around. I have sworn by this phone for the majority of time I've had with it. In June, my battery started being finnicky and my phone would shut down randomly at anywhere from 5% to 15%. I had also recieved numerous reports that my mic was not working correctly and that has only continued to get worse. I can usually only have phone calls over bluetooth now.


So, I contacted live support and they created a ticket for me. I was initially very optimistic, as the representative helping me was incredibly active and attentive in doing what he needed to.

It seemed the issue was that my warranty wasn't being recognized because it wasn't attached to my current device. I'd gotten two replacements-- one, I dropped it and the screen cracked, and then, two, they sent me a replacement that stopped working almost immediately after I got it. They replaced the faulty one immediately and told me it would not count against my device warranty, as it was mailed faulty.


But, my initial representative identified the issue and moved the warranty to my device-- or so he said. I then was assigned a new representative and recieved [this](https://imgur.com/Fr4Ck9n) for the following five months. 

Today, I was told that my warranty was expired and that they could be of no help. [Here](https://imgur.com/xx0qHgE) is a copy of my receipt, showing that my warranty isn't expired. This is included in the very first of [OVER 70 emails](https://imgur.com/XO1GBK3) that we exchanged just trying to get me a phone that I could use to actually call people!

This also indicates that my first support representative did not do what he told me he did and move my warranty.

I am very frustrated. I don't know what to do at this point. I will be opening another ticket and be posting this anywhere online that I can. I hope that someone here could provide guidance, or, better yet, someone from support who is actually willing to resolve my issue sees this. 

I just want a working phone.


TL;DR- Bought warranty with OG Pixel. Wasn't on my account for some reason. Google support said they fixed it. Five months later, they tell me otherwise and close my ticket.


Thanks for reading.


EDIT: First of all, I'd like to thank you guys for all the support. It's *looking like* this is going to get resolved and that's exciting.

GooglePixel,A public plea for Google to make a small Pixel,"I recently tried to use the Pixel 7 (coming from the Pixel 4a, used the Pixel 2 previously) and I just can't get used to the size difference.

I'm not sure if there are others who experience the same thing, but 6.3"" for a phone seems to be on the larger/near unusable side for me. It's not even being able to reach across the width of the screen, it's how tall the thing is and cumbersome it is to carry around. It feel slippery with the glass, the bump doesn't work for holding it with smaller/regular sized hands as well.

I'm curious if others have experienced the same thing. I imagine this shift to larger screens is matching the time and what sales figures dictate, but Google - please consider those of us who enjoy a smaller phone!

Edit: First, lots of mentions of the Pixel 6a. Although it has a smaller screen, it has nearly the same footprint as the Pixel 7, so it's simply not a ""small"" phone

Second, Asus Zenfone 9. I'm not sure how well it will work with my phone plan, but I'm willing to give it a shot, especially because it's quite close to stock android. I may update with a later post! Not sure if that's allowed though, as it's technically not Pixel-related.

This necessarily requires device admin permission so you have to reasonably trust the app. Someone in the comments mentioned [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsc.lock) and said they were using exactly in the way you intend it too, just add ""open Lock"" to your Assistant routine. If you don't trust the app but trust Tasker and Tasker Factory's developer, you can use them to make a ""system lock"" task, then export it as app and give it any name you want (e.g. so it's unambiguous to Assistant what it should ""open""). Going that way I'd recommend targeting an older API because targeting a recent one for some reason requires the app running as a foreground service.

GooglePixel,Pixel over iPhone... it's NOT about the Customization,"**\*\*\*Disclaimer\*\*\***

This post is NOT another ""here's why the Pixel is better than the iPhone"" rant. **It's a rant against tech sites** who seem to only mention Android's customization as the primary advantage over iOS when making their comparisons. If you're here to reply with ""but iPhones are better because of x,y, and z,"" then please don't bother replying and move on to the next thread.

**Original Post**

Every Android vs iOS comparison I read [lists the iPhone advantages and then lists a few Android advantages](https://www.androidcentral.com/why-i-carry-iphone-and-android-phone). However, they always start off the Android section with the SAME advantage... Customization.

Well guess what, iPhone users don't care about customization; otherwise, they'd be using Android. I'm here to lay out some actual, functional advantages to using Android (specifically, the Google Pixel series):

1. File Management - not only can you easily access the internal file structure from the phone, you can plug it into a computer and read it like a flash drive. This makes file management SUPER easy and effective on Android.
2. Mobile Data - Android does not restrict you from using your mobile data to download ""large"" files >150 mb. What's the point of having unlimited data plans if you have to connect to WiFi just to download a game or music album?
3. Cross-platform Compatibility - seriously, why should I have to buy a $1,500 Mac Book just to send text messages from my computer? Android Messages works through ANY browser. Plus, NFC actually works for more than just mobile payments.
4. Deeper 3rd Party App Integration - ""but, Snap Chat looks better on iPhone!"" ....FVCK SNAPCHAT!  I'm talking about 3rd party apps being crippled on iOS because iOS doesn't play nicely with anything that doesn't have an Apple logo on it. Take Google Photos for example. The key feature is the cloud backups to preserve your photos in case anything happens to your device. But if you have an iPhone, you can't even count on the app to backup photos unless you open the G\_Photos app, manually start the backup process, and then don't switch to a different app because of my next point...
5. True Multi-Tasking - forget the fact that Pixels can run split screen apps or picture in picture. I'm talking about simply starting a process on one app, and switching to another app WITHOUT the first app pausing the process. It's not really a smart phone if the iPhone can't run processes in the background.
6. Everything Else - better notification management, faster LTE/WiFi modems, fast charging included standard, native USB-C support, in-app settings management (seriously, I have to exit the app I'm using and dig through the long a\*\* general settings menu to change an app-specific setting?), more advance sharing options, and I'm sure there's a ton more...

But in just 5 minutes, I was able to list a bevy of genuine advantages the Pixel series has over the iPhone series, and I did so without ONCE mentioning, ""But the customization!"" These tech reviewers need to start digging deeper than just their home screen layouts on these phones. No one is going to give Android any serious consideration if they think the only advantage is changing the shape/color of the app icons.

GooglePixel,I don't know what kind of black magic the Pixel 7 is using to screen robocalls but I'm never buying a phone that can't do this.,"On my S22(same number) I was getting 8-9 calls a day plus several scam texts. In the week I've had the Pixel 7 Pro I've gotten exactly one text message and one phone call that was screened with the Assistant and that was it.

I just didn't realize it was going to work so well or at all. Its my favorite feature without a doubt and I ain't ever buying a phone without it."
GooglePixel,Gentle reminder for Anyone who just got a new Pixel,"Every single year since the original Pixel, people have come to Reddit and expressed extreme disappointment with the battery, The performance, and features not working just as they expected. 

Then within a month, the trend is to reverse that position.  The battery starts working better the features work more like expected, etc.

There are many factors that create this, but some are the built-in optimization functions of the phone sorting themselves out, others is patches that come after release, and then there's an inherent extreme usage that we have when we first get a new phone. The user is using their phone more, apps were just downloaded and so they are downloading their data and optimizations, etc. 

Already you can see people on this forum saying that it's a miracle now (compared to a few days ago) their batteries running a lot longer and the phone is heating up much less. I predict we will continue to see this trend. 

If you search message history back to every pixel release you'll see a similar result."

The Pixel 7 Pro has been an amazing experience so far and I believe it's on par with the Apple iPhone. There's only one thing that Apple does that I really believe gives them a significant competitive edge over the Pixel phones, and that most tech normies recognize, and that is customer service and post-purchase support. 

Why doesn't Google implement a Genius Bar-like service at their Google stores? Where, like with Apple, if I'm under warranty or have Apple Care, I can get my screen replaced or the entire phone replaced if needed. 

Google's online tech support and on-the-phone customer service is atrocious and unhelpful - virtually non-existent.

If Google implements these critical services, I think it would motivate quite a bit of customers to join Pixel. Customers want to know they have somewhere to go if they have a hardware issue with their phone. I just don't know if they're making the revenue on Pixel to justify such a service and the needed infrastructure."

I went to Best Buy and tried the 6 Pro out. I tried to use nearby share to copy pictures off the phone but couldn't get it to work, but here's an album with some of the notable things I saw

https://photos.app.goo.gl/LGQ4TL7JctmmEM3o8

1. The curve really isn't too bad. Screen looked great - crazy fast compared to my 3 and noticably brighter

2. Zoom looked really good. I included .7, 1, 2, 4, and 20x. 20 is obviously not acceptable for normal pictures but it still has okay details

3. New stabilization options (unless I just never knew other pixels had those)

4. Couldn't find the new dynamic photo feature but magic eraser works well enough. Still not as good as a manual Photoshop but unless you're looking for errors you probably wouldn't notice someone was removed from a pic

5. Squeeze for assistant is gone but now holding the power button triggers assistant! Not sure if you can change it in settings

\-

Edit: I'm thinking of going back tomorrow when I have more time to check audio quality and vibration haptics, anything else I should look at?

E2: Checking audio quality vs 6, front camera pro vs 6, haptics vs 6, (manual) screen brightness vs 6, viewing angles of Pro vs 6, double tap for camera, photos upload, square picture, face unlock, macro/distance to object, PIP, palm rejection, volume steps, model numbers, gesture nav options, 24 fps, online gpu test, fingerprints, polarized glasses, outgoing call, streamable, 6 max zoom pic

E3: https://photos.app.goo.gl/V9hH7hYvHG78E6Jn7

I couldn't use the pro at all because the pixel area was really busy 👀, but I tried to check most things

First I'm going to go through features that weren't there and one concern after that there's no particular order

One of the pixel 6's was really low on battery (even though they have it plugged in all the time?) And it was definitely running slower than the other  
There was no square picture mode, 24 fps option, UW autofocus, outgoing call confirmation, unlimited photo upload, or face unlock

For audio quality: there's a front and bottom firing speaker. They sound good but not amazing, get loud but not crazy loud

The front camera of the 6 was noticably worse than the pro. Not bad but not great either. It might just be the pre release software but it seems worse than my 3

I included a picture of the notification bar height. It is centered on the camera cutout which sucks, but most of the apps had it blend into the UI well

The minimum focus distance of the 6 camera was pretty far

The haptics were sharp but weak for my liking

Screen viewing angles and brightness was very good for both

There were 25 steps for the volume, same as my 3 in Android 12

I have a picture with the model number of a pixel 6

You can still use 3 button navigation

You can easily get fingerprints on the back, but they aren't glaringly obvious. It was really hard to even get a picture of them showing

Max zoom of the 6 was 7x and it looked fine. It looks to me like there's more detail than the 20x(5x digital) on the pro but idk

I also took a video of the different stabilization demos because it looked cool lol"

GooglePixel,Beware of Google's warranty scam,"I LOVE my Pixel 5, but you need to be aware Google support is now using ANY wear and tear to justify not repairing your phone and honoring the warranty.

I sent my phone in, at their request, to fix a software issue, and they told me due to ""damage"" they wouldn't fix the phone unless I paid $180. I told them there wasn't damage, asking them if they broke it, and that's when they started playing games. They refused to tell me what the damage was, refused to send me a photo, but wanted me to pay without any confirmation. 

After hanging up on me 4 times, and after nearly 70 emails back and forth, each time with a new person, I finally confirmed the ""damage"" was a scratch on the bottom of the phone. They confirmed the phone had problems that were under warranty, but wouldn't fix them because they said they don't fix phones anymore. Instead, they only replace them because repairs are too expensive. To qualify for a replacement, they can't have any signs of wear and tear.

One guy actually went through the fine print with me line by line, and when he discovered he was wrong said ""this will help your case"" and then he turned it over to a higher tier, where the entire cycle started over. 

Finally—after getting a rep to admit there was nothing in their fine print that voided my warranty, they granted me an ""exception"" BUT mailed my broken phone back to me. After I told them the error, they simply said to send it back in and we will check, asking me to submit a new support ticket.  They said now they can't send a repair because I took too long! 

Beware, if your phone has any wear and tear and suffers a problem, you're screwed. Their warranty is essentially a scam.

GooglePixel,Beware when trading in your Pixel devices to Google,"I recently had a very upsetting experience with Google on a trade in issue.  I had a Pixel 4, in excellent condition, I babied that phone, always was in a protective case and used with Google approved chargers and accessories.

I decided to trade in the Pixel 4 for a Pixel 5 because Google was offering $290 for my 4, I didn't really need a new phone because the phone worked great, but the credit for trade was too good to pass up.  I ran diagnostics, factory reset the phone and sent it in the provided box - I was confident knowing the phone was in tip top shape.

Well, much to my surprise I get an email from Google, they devalued my Pixel 4 and are only giving me $58 in credit.  I was like WHAT????  That is a $232 dollar difference!  I promptly contacted Google support, I tried my best not to take out my irritation on the customer service rep, but he said the phone was devalued by $232 because the battery exploded / or was bloated.  Hmm, so my phone was working perfectly, passed the diagnostics, and then when Google gets it, it powers on with an exploded battery!!

I let the CSR know that I wanted this issue resolved, a quick internet search and you can see that a replacement battery is about $70, yet Google devalues my phone by $232?  I gave Google 2 choices, either Google return my phone, or give me more credit, because $58 is insulting and damn near criminal if you ask me.  I even offered to pay for the shipping to return my old phone.

The CSR said that I marked the box to not return my phone, so they couldn't (ok, this was clearly before I knew that Google would rip me off), and they were not going to credit me anything additional.  This was the most piss poor customer service I have received in a long time, I am sooo disappointed in Google, they literally lost my respect in an instant.

I let the CSR know that I have spent thousands on Google products, and I have encouraged my friends and family to do the same, but no longer.  I will tell everyone and everybody that will listen about my Google experience, and I will be phasing out anything I have from Google.  Google might have made $232, but they just lost thousands in future revenue and my respect, and to think I was considering signing up for FI, lol! glad I dodged that bullet.  Google customer service = Comcast imo.

It's not about the money to me, it's about the principle.  Why not send me my old phone back?  Would it be really that hard to do, or just offer me a credit of some kind?  I clearly took very good care of the phone, and if it did have a battery issue that says more about Google workmanship than my treatment of the phone.

TLDR - sorry for the long post, I just wanted to get my story out to anyone that was thinking about trading in their Google devices for new ones.

Thanks to [dmziggy](https://www.reddit.com/user/dmziggy/) for being able to facilitate a resolution with Google support.

GooglePixel,Google Now: From Useful to Useless,
GooglePixel,Pixel 5 is the best phone I have ever had hands down. I don't understand any of the hate that it got.,"So I know there's been so many of these posts but I just wanted to be another voice to say that all these reviewers who are saying the pixel 5 is bad are looking at it from such weird angle. 

I got my pixel 5 a few days ago to replace my OnePlus 6. My pixel has been hands down already a better experience. I know that the OnePlus 6 was one of their peak phones: super snappy, great screen for its price and awesome build quality - but the pixel 5 with its ""worse"" processor and un-flagship nature is 100% better. 

I've been able to do everything that I could do on my OnePlus 6 just as, if not better, on my pixel. It's snappy, super smooth and looks even better playing games like real racing and PUBG compared to my 6 thanks to its 90hz and graphics. Even though the pixel has a ""budget"" processor it absolutely flies through tasks despite it being a little worse than the 845 my old phone had on paper. 

Things that people have been complaining about like speakers, haptics or build seem to me as completely wrong. I love the way that the sound comes right at you through the screen like on those expensive Sony TV's. And the haptics are honestly up there with the typing experience on my GF's iPhone XS. I also love the playful sorta sage and the feel of it. It almost looks like it's made of felt or something when you look at it. With the built in positives of wireless charging and water proofing. 

Battery life has also been stellar and the 5G speeds and reliability are absolutely awesome.

So, I honestly hate how much this phone copped from reviewers and users. 

Yes it's different to the fully fledged, throw everything we have approach of previous pixels but I'm very happy with the lower processor but keeping everything else to give me a flagship phone for $999AUD compared to the $1250 or $1400 for other flagships. For me in Australia this has been cheaper than even a oneplus or s20 fe with a free nest hub max to sweeten the deal. 

Nobody really uses their phone for demanding tasks and I reckon you'd be hard pressed to notice an improvement between the pixel 5 and other flagships like the S20. People seem to think that everyone needs the best processor for all the 4K editing and hardcore gaming they're going to be doing. Nobody actually cares, the difference between recent processors and performance have been so minimal you couldn't blindly tell the difference between a phone from 3 years ago vs today. 90hz or above is the new and only way to make a phone feel faster. 

TL:DR the obsession of critics and reviewers that no price of tech is good unless it has the cutting edge features even if it's completely overkill has given this phone some very mixed reviews and receptions. Anyone who was to buy this one would be hard pressed to find a major flaw. It's got everything you need in a phone for a cheaper price."

GooglePixel,Compilation of why Android 12 is not so good [with screenshots],"What the hell are you doing, Google?

After updating(Pixel 4), I have noticed a couple of really bad design elements, disallowing the person to choose what's best for them and then - plain worsening of the usability aspects.

""Pixel that adapts to you"" my ass. Changing accent colors based on wallpaper is marketed as advanced adapting? Taking away the user's options is the worst thing that Google could do to their customers - people who enjoy customization & advanced users who use Android devices for a reason.

Here is a list of some of the ""this is dumb"" experiences I have found from my usage, and from others as well

1. Lock screen clock. It's huge, it's not adjustable in any way and it looks ugly (this, of course, depends on the person, but not having the ability to change it is pretty wild) [https://postimg.cc/V51VthNj/a3650fda](https://postimg.cc/V51VthNj/a3650fda)
2. Clock widget on the home screen. What is up with the ugly ass background, why can't we have an option to enjoy the wallpaper that we as users CHOOSE to set. Wasn't this what the marketing was all about? Phone adjusting to ME? This is just purely idiotic decision - why wouldn't you leave the old widgets as well, why do you have to push such shitty UI elements onto people? [https://postimg.cc/ZBY6b6Ty](https://postimg.cc/ZBY6b6Ty)   
edit: this seems to be a bug. some people(including me) are not seeing the option to remove the background, some are.   

3. Can't click on the date in the ""At a glance"" widget to open Calendar. (From comments) You can't click on the clock in the notification shade as well anymore.
4. The bubbly/stretchy animation - it's smooth, but it's not really nice seeing my whole screen bouncing around when I get to the bottom or top of something. This is especially noticeable in The App Drawer. This now feels like a kid's toy, not a device that power users could use.
5. Quick toggles - I for one don't mind the new design, but the fact that you can't change how round the borders are and how much space there is in the toggles themselves - that's just wasted space. On a similar note - it's impossible to flick-swipe the toggles away now. You have to swipe up 2 times, instead of 1 flick, to return to the app you were using. [https://postimg.cc/Hjqj3bf4](https://postimg.cc/Hjqj3bf4)
6. What's a lot worse - is the fact that, for some reason, Google decided that transparent backgrounds are the enemy of state and forced solid background in both - app drawer and app switcher (and probably elsewhere). What makes it worse though, is how bad it's done. If you go in an app, press and pull the app switcher up (without releasing), the background is your wallpaper. Only after you release - the background becomes solid. (From comments) This also happens for the notification shade, even if you don't have any notifications... WHAT PROBLEM DOES THIS SOLVE OTHER THAN ME NOT BEING ABLE TO ENJOY MY WALLPAPER? [https://postimg.cc/gallery/zK9pBGx](https://postimg.cc/gallery/zK9pBGx)
7. Continuing with the idiotic design elements - The App Drawer. It doesn't look half bad, until you start scrolling. Suddenly a big gray rectangle appears at the top. For some reason the search bar is sticky, with an ugly solid background, and, of course, there's no way to change it. [https://postimg.cc/gallery/zv5qW83](https://postimg.cc/gallery/zv5qW83)
8. The ""styling"" of the Google Launcher. You can't change the style of little icons anymore, you can't change the style of big icons, you can't change the fonts, you can't change the accent colors to anything else than the bland 4 colors that are provided by Google. You basically can't do anything customization-wise, that you could on Android 11.[https://postimg.cc/94ZXzfmP](https://postimg.cc/94ZXzfmP)
9. And now to the worst offender - the notifications. Grouping is different (worse), each notification in the shade takes up a lot more space - not because there's more information, but because of the rounded corners and added spacing in each notification. One message takes up half the screen, basically. [https://postimg.cc/Hc3g7cfM](https://postimg.cc/Hc3g7cfM)
10. (From comments) Everything looks monotonous.
11. (From comments) At a glance widget taking up the whole width of the screen for some reason.
12. (From comments) Font size feels too big. If you go into settings and change it - then it's too small. There's a noticeable ""gap"" between the settings now, where you can't get the font to be ""just right"".

Don't get me wrong - the update is probably a good thing, but the ""minor"" things that Google has left in there - that look plain ugly, that worsens the experience, that ruins the look of the device completely is too much to handle.

In addition - I'm usually very open minded to visual changes and different experiences, but this update, especially from UI/UX perspective just feels cheap. It feels like I traded in my smartphone for a toy.

I would like for someone at Google to read this, but they probably won't, and probably wouldn't care anyways. For the first time since owning the device I'm feeling like I will have to go with custom rom to be able to adjust MY experience with the device.

Google has released first hardware upgrade for their cameras in years - that could welcome a lot of new users. The new Tensor chip sounds awesome as well. The price is very aggressively set.

But every single thing of that won't matter, if the software experience feels cheap and looks like crap.

Rant over, cheers.

GooglePixel,This year I FINALLY had the absolute pleasure of having my family prefer the photos my Pixel 6 Pro made over the ones taken by my sister's iPhone 12,"I have been waiting to join the Pixel family since the very introduction of the first Pixel. Every year, I would postpone it because there was always something that wouldn't convince me, and so I would stick to OnePlus phones that were indeed awesome, but really lacked in the photo department. 

Each year, the moment for family photos would come, and I would just let my sister do all the work with her iphone because there was simply no competition. 

This year I finally joined the Google family with my Pixel 6 Pro and I was ready to challenge the iPhone regime. 

We started with both phones taking pictures, and it was tense. After the first 4-5 pics, we let each family member thoroughly look at each photo and decide who should take the crown, and after a close inspection the verdict was up : they asked to take more pics using only MY Pixel 6 Pro. I'm telling you, I never felt more proud. 

In my household, my father, my mother and my sister all use iPhones, I was always the only one using Android phones. So this was even more of a satisfaction. 

I know it's silly, but I'm so glad that they commented with things like ""oh yeah his photos are MUCH better, way more colorful and stuff"". It really made my day.

Merry Christmas everybody <3"

I've never once used power saving mode on this phone and its not set to auto on. my friend just texted me saying his did the exact same thing out of nowhere in his p1. wtf? it just did it again at 73 percent too. it's turning auto power saving mode on by itself, and it's set to turn on at 99 percent.
*edit* RIP my inbox lol crazy.  i did note that i received the security update for sept last night, but didn't install until today.  i also noticed at 2am last night that i did not have LTE connectivity, it ws completely broken...it was like that for over 12 hours until i rebooted phone and it came back.  no idea if that has anything to do with it.  also glad to see i'm not the only one freaked out that google can remotely access settings on our phones and do shit.  ridiculous.  also, i'm in NJ, not in path of hurricane."
GooglePixel,Google Pixel's newest celebrity brand ambassador is Simu Liu (Shang-Chi),
GooglePixel,Google changed my device trade in value from $350 to $17.50.,"Traded in a Note 10+ and just got an email saying my trade in was credited for $17.50 with absolutely no explanation. There were no issues with the device, it was free of cracks, turned on, and was factory reset. Anyone else have them reject a trade in?

Update: I spoke with CS and they are ""opening an investigation."" They say the reason for the lower credit is that there was a model mismatch. The email I got says ""Reported device condition: Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (256GB Other)"" and ""Condition when received : Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (256GB Other). Obviously the same model. I'm highly skeptical that they will actually correct it. But I have a video of the device on the initial setup screen, showing no scratches or cracks, powering down, and being packed in the trade in kit. I also have the receipt from Samsung showing the model. I'll continue to fight.

Edit: I know that I could get probably double that for a Note 10+ by selling it but I'm busy and it was convenient to just trade in as part of the purchase. I expected that selling it elsewhere would be more of a headache but here we are.

Update on a new post: https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jwfosu"
GooglePixel,Anyone else wish for a smaller pixel phone?,"I really enjoyed the pixel 3 size, it was not too big, not too small and just perfect. Curious to see if anyone else would also enjoy a new smaller sized pixel.

Edit: just adding that I find the pixel 6 so big"
GooglePixel,Home alone by Google ;),
GooglePixel,"If Google built a phone with the body of a Galaxy S10 and the software of a Pixel, it would sell like crazy","Obviously this is hypothetical. Google Pixels are wonderful devices, I own one, and I'll be buying the 4 XL in Q4. However, the hardware in the Samsung Galaxy devices is just so much better. The only reason I don't buy Samsung phones is because of the sofware. I don't like OneUI (haters gonna hate), I love stock Android, I love quick updates, I love the smooth snappy nature of my 2 XL.

If Google could bring this, plus all the Pixel-specific stuff to a phone with the hardware of an S10/S10+, then I'd buy it. The better screen, the bigger battery, the build quality, the thin bezels, all of it. It's a shame this would never happen, but we can dream.

The only thing I'd miss is squeeze for assistant, I love it.  


EDIT: Thanks for all the comments. I'm not suggesting doing this would launch Google ahead of Samsung (although if that's their goal then they would have to do this + advertise more). These are just my thoughts on how Google could vastly improve their sales numbers, I'm not saying this would be the end of Samsung. I forgot to mention that I'd expect it to keep dual front-firing speakers, and even the two-toned rear design would be fine. Wasn't necessarily talking about the curved edges either. I meant the internals (more RAM, storage, bigger battery) + screen tech (better AMOLED, pin-hole design, small bezels) of a Samsung."
GooglePixel,"Well, it finally happened to me from Google.","Bought the Pixel 7 and Google said they'd offer $250 on our Pixel 3 trade-in, so I accepted that method.  Our Pixel 3 had been fully cases since day one, zero cracks, zero scratches, and functioned great. Absolutely nothing wrong with the phone in our consumer eyes.

Made a video of it working and me packing it up for trade-in. I sent it off on Saturday and I wake up this morning to find it had been assessed, found that the battery was swollen, and that the new value was zero!

We had no indication when looking at the phone of a swollen battery issue. Absolutely nothing whatsoever. I would have not kept and used the phone if a swollen battery issue was present, let alone try to trade it in when claiming perfect condition.

I called support and was sent to escalation purgatory. Basically, as usual with Google, it sounded as of nothing could be done and I should just go fuck myself. 

Jesus, why did I ever think I wouldn't get fucked by this shit hole company?"

GooglePixel,Pixel 6 gave my wife some peace of mind,"Despite some of the bugginess of the pixel 6, my pixel brought my wife a moment of peace during a hard time. She lost her dad suddenly over 4 years ago and has moments of really intense grief. It can be so intense that it will make her physically sick. While trying to comfort her, I asked her to tell me one of her favorite memories about her Dad. She told me about a time when he accidentally nicked his mustache and had to shave it completely off. This made him, in her words, ""look like a turtle"" until it grew back. This memory made her laugh for the first time in almost a week of intense pain and sickness. I pulled out my Pixel 6 and in a few quick swipes used magic eraser to erase the mustache off a picture I had of her dad on my phone. I showed her the end result and seeing her eyes light up and have her laugh and smile made my day.  So while I've had my frustrations about the pixel, this moment was something only it could give me. Thanks Pixel team.

TL:DR- I used magic eraser to bring my grieving wife a good memory of her father.

EDIT: Wow I was not expect awards for this. Thanks for all the kind words and thoughts. I posted this story just to show how a simple phone feature brought my wife and I a smile and I'm glad it brought some of y'all one too. Sadly everybody loses somebody and people grieve differently but any little ray of sunshine helps."

Family and friends ask me what phone to get because I used to be a computer guy. Been recommending pixels since they started making them. Zero complaints from probably 15 or so people that bought em.

Reading half the comments on this sub one is ridiculous. People want headphone jack, top of the line processor, 16 GB ram, perfect 1080p 60 fps video and can store 80 GB video files, the best camera, AND a sub $500 price. I could go on.

Pixels have the best software, best camera, and a reasonable price. I'm beyond excited for a phone with an edge to edge screen and decent battery size.

TLDR: I'm jacked for the P5 so quit bitching about it."
GooglePixel,A plea to Google: please invest in your customer service and aftercare support to have any chance of competing in this market.,"Great Customer service and after care support are essential in today’s consumerist world. I’m a huge Google fan and have had their devices since the nexus tablets. But no matter how good and how smart their devices become, if things go south we need to be able to rely on their help. I read negative experiences daily about Google support and their 3rd party service centres on this sub. It pains me to see so many people leave android to iOS purely because of this reason. This is literally a plea to Google that no matter what product they release on may 10th, in October, next year, etc, people want a brand they can trust and we need Google to invest in this area.

-Not having your own service centres is not good enough.
-Not having a physical store apart from in the US in todays market is not good enough.
-The hours of troubleshooting your agents make people do before approving a return or exchange over chat/phone is not good enough."

GooglePixel,"If you have an alarm set, you should be alerted if your alarm volume is low or off","Sometimes I seem to somehow lower my alarm volume in the volume settings (no idea how it happens) and have had a few late mornings as a result of it.

It may seem that way, I get it. People are always going to post about the bad experiences they have; but people are rarely if ever going to post about their good experiences.

The fact is that probably 90% of users with these phones and Android 12, probably have the same experience as you: flawless. They just don't post about it.

GooglePixel,I wish Google would release another *small* phone,"I love have a Pixel phone because the forced apps and skins of Samsung and other makers just piss me off every time I have to interact with them. 

I just upgraded from a Pixel 4a to a 6a, and finding myself annoyed at the size upgrade. Not only is it taller by almost a centimeter (and I have relatively small hands) but the weight difference is quite noticeable.   


iPhone has several sizes available, including the mini and the SE. Would it kill Google to come out with an actual low-end phone? Anyone else feeling overburdened this year?"
GooglePixel,Anyone else staying to have second thoughts about continuing as a Google user in the future?,"Like, don't get me wrong, i just bought a pixel 4a 5g and I'm loving it. I'll use this phone until it's time to move on. That being said, the revelation that future pixels will no longer feature unlimited cloud storage, along with Google's recent dropping of previously available consumer-friendly features elsewhere (looking at you, photos app), and now just today seeing them say that the Google Pay app is going to start charging fees for instant transfers... And then there's the big uptick in ads on YouTube that started recently, as well as the terms of service saying they're going to start putting ads on small creators videos without adding them to the partners program. I'm really seeing Google move in this direction of ""taking features away one inch at a time, not giving you anything in return, and hoping you don't notice."" 

Like, pixel user from day one here. I went Pixel XL - 3A XL - 4A 5G. I don't want to move away because i love the stock android experience and the awesome quality of the photos. But like, the google user future is looking pretty bleak right now, right?

Like, hoping the company proves me wrong but it's not looking like that's the case right now. Might have to look towards OnePlus or even that Sony Xperia line in the future.

GooglePixel,The Pixel 6 has made me realize that r/Android just needs something to complain about,"With the Pixel 6, Google is giving everyone practically what they've been asking for. Top specs at a relatively cheap price. Where else do you get 128gb, 90hz screen, flagship cameras, 5 years of security updates, 4k video, and more for $599?

Yet browse r/Android and it reeks of negativity. 

I don't understand. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Has the sub just got too big for its own good? Feels like it has reached irreversible levels of toxicity. I really feel like the place just needs something to bitch about."

GooglePixel,How many people have no issues with their phone?,"It is known that people who are having trouble are much more vocal than people who are not.

What I'd like, is if you own a Pixel and have not had any trouble, just leave a little message.

I've only had my 3XL for a week but all the threads on here makes it feel like my phone is going to have trouble at any moment, however this very well could be a major imbalance between vocal unhappy people and silent happy people.

So please, if you haven't had any trouble, leave a message! This way we can feel what percent of people are having trouble vs those with no trouble and it might make those of us with no trouble a little less anxious that it's going to blow up in our face, maybe literally.

Thank you!

The only trouble I have had was I needed to restart my phone to apply the January patch yesterday, it wouldn't download otherwise, not sure if I can be considered ""trouble free"" or not, but I'm considering it trouble free as the phone hardware seems fine.

edit: i think in the interest of fairness, minor issues will be considered ""no issue"" if they can be easily corrected like okay google not working until you restart the phone, as these kinds of thinks can most likely be corrected in software updates. Hardware updates cannot be considered ""no issue"".

Edit 2: this was exactly the kind of response I hoped for, one where the good thread outweighs the bad. Thanks everyone!

Edit 3: is this seriously going to break 1000 comments? Holy shit guys, I feel a lot better about my phone!"

GooglePixel,First time Pixel owner found a very cool easter egg!,"I wake up every morning to my Pixel playing a Spotify playlist for an alarm and then a news top stories list. But this morning was different as it was my birthday, and IT SANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME! It's silly and surely on other phones, but I'd never heard that until now. It's the little things that just keep me excited about my Pixel well after I bought it!

Anyway, pointless post but it was exciting enough to me that I wrote this up before getting out of bed. :P Have a great day everyone!"

GooglePixel,Just got a Pixel 6. The front facing fingerprint scanner is FINE.,"Coming over from a note 8 which has a rear facing fingerprint scanner. I came into this phone and expected the worst. But i set up 4 different fingerprints, one for each thumb and one for each index finger and I have had ZERO issues unlocking my phone. 

Yes it might be a hair slower in some situations, but I've not had one instance where I needed to use my pin instead of my fingerprint to unlock. How is everyone having so many issues with this?  

Additionally, to those who say bring back the rear facing fingerprint scanner, I say nay. I like having it on the front of my screen and not having to pick up my phone while at my desk. Maybe switch to an ultrasonic on the next Pixel. I know I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but most of you are making a way bigger deal out of this than it is."
GooglePixel,As soon as I get my P4XL I’m done with tech news,"Something I noticed was that as I learned more and more about phones it started to ruin the use ability of them. I would be checking for updates steadying tech news analyzing how my phone worked. As soon as I get my Pixel 4, a phone I’m paying for through a contract (haven’t done this since my 6s) I’m going to cut out all tech news reddit posts and the likes. Allow myself to just use my phone as a consumer and not an enthusiast. I’m curious if anyone else thinks that ignorance is bliss with phones and for someone looking to use a phone for a while is it healthier to do this?"
GooglePixel,pixel 6 pro failed to connect to 911 last week.,"Google is knowingly still selling phones that won't connect to 911 and it almost cost my child his life last week. My Pixel 6 Pro failed to connect to 911 over 17 times. I purchased it directly from Google /Google Fi in August. I do not, nor have I ever had Teams installed. I've not had any other call or service failures prior to or after. The issue is exclusive to calling emergency services. 

Details: 
On 9/27/22, I received a call from my sitter saying that my five year old had begun seizing and was unresponsive. I told her I was on my way, and I would call 911. (So that she could focus on my child and trying to keep him safe under the circumstances) I tried calling 911 at least 17 times on my Google Pixel 6 Pro from the time I left my office, and it failed to connect every single time. I tried dialing direct from the keypad, I tried from the emergency lock screen, I tried everything. I'd not had any service or call issues before that point. Thank God my work was only five minutes away the way I drove, and Andrew was still breathing when I got there. 

Once my child was stabilized and here at Wolfson's, I began looking into the issue. It turns out that this is a known issue with Pixel phones. Other users have experienced technical glitches preventing them from calling 911 during a life or death crisis. Google knows this, did not release an alert or statement upon learning about it, eventually released an update that allegedly fixed the issue in older pixel phones, but not 6 or 6 pro, which I just purchased. Users of these phones may find themselves or their loved ones dead because Google, the largest tech company on the planet, can't seem to fix this issue and doesn't have the moral backbone to pull the phones from market until they do, or at the very least make current users aware that they may be not be able to contact emergency services when needed - the absolutely most vital function of any phone.

GooglePixel,How to use OG Pixel as an unlimited Google Photos uploader.,"I had my old Pixel lying around doing nothing, so I decided to take advantage of the unlimited original quality Google Photos uploads for life, rather than having to be limited by High Quality on my Pixel 5, or pay ongoing subscription costs.

Firstly I factory reset it, then signed in and made sure Google Photos was set to upload in Original Quality. I installed Solid Explorer, which I'd previously bought the full version of. Then I used the FTP server function so I could connect to the DCIM folder remotely.

On my Pixel 5, I disabled Google Photos backup, and installed FolderSync. I created a folder pair to connect DCIM on the P5 to DCIM on the P1 via the FTP server. I set it to sync every six hours if I'm on my home WiFi, and delete the local copies when the sync succeeded (i.e. move rather than copy). Finally I set up a home screen widget on the P5 to initiate the sync manually.

The P1 stays plugged in and the FTP server is always available, so I can take endless photos and shoot 4k video on the P5, and let it sync on a regular basis, also clearing space. The P1 is set to Smart Storage to automatically remove local copies of backed up photos and videos, so as not to run out of space. To test it, I've kicked off a sync and a couple of minutes later, my P5 DCIM folder is empty (checked with Solid Explorer), the files are all on the P1 (again checked with SE) and they're all backed up to Google Photos (checked with the Google Photos web interface in Chrome).

Edited to add:

You'll also need to make sure your Pixel 1 is set to a static IP in your router's settings so that the FTP details don't change.

GooglePixel,Dear Google,Please don't put a notch on the pixel 3. I would much rather have top and bottom bezzles than an annoying forehead on my phone.
GooglePixel,PLEASE bring back the Power Button Screenshot option!,"I excitedly updated to Android 11 last week.
I take a lot of screenshots, and was immediately confused when holding down the power button yielded no results. I immediately Googled how to take a screenshot with Android 11, and it's SO UNWIELDY! 
Using the power button enabled me to only have to use one hand to both hold the power button down, and press the screenshot button on the screen it pulled up. This method, of using the power and volume down buttons, makes me have to use two hands, because I have an Otterbox, and the buttons are too hard to press down with two fingers on the same hand. 
Please, please, PLEASE bring the power button option back. 
Please."

You gave a company decent money, and that money wasn't faulty. You didn't promise Google you'd get them good money later in some update. 

If it acts up, return it asap. Wait for them to fix the product before you purchase again, or just jump ship. You, and I, don't owe Google anything to be their beta testers. I enjoy their products, but only when they work."
GooglePixel,#BestPhonesForever: new Pixel ads... featuring iPhone,
GooglePixel,I think Google is starting to understand hardware,"I know it is a bit early and we need to look at the next 12 months before we can conclude this. I do however feel that the 4a is a product launch from someone who actually understands hardware. Some of the problems Google has had over the years (and frankly continues to be plagued with) are as follows:

1. Overpricing. I think we can all agree with this

2. Trying to immitate Apple in the wrong things - price, storage options, etc, while not making an attempt at emulating good aspects like excellent customer service and products that are well tested and without flaws (eg pixel 2 screen issues)

3. Distribution issues

4. Lack of availability outside USA and EU. 

5. Quality control issues


The 4a launch does not guarantee that the device or distribution will be flawless, far from it in fact. However, the one thing they have absolutely nailed is having a single SKU. This may sound like a mundane silly thing, however it offers a lot of benefits:

1. Distribution. No sending out x number of units for 64gb black and y number for 128gb white, and then playing Russian roulette with customer demand. They need to be stocked in just one SKU.

2. The customer knows what they want. If they are convinced to buy a 4a, there is no further decision to make about color and storage size. You do not risk losing a sale because a customer decides they want 'Ooh la la Green' but it is out of stock. 

3. It is easier to ensure world wide availability - again related to lower distribution costs 

4. Production is much easier - place one order for the device rather than 6 for 3 colors in 2 storage sizes. 

5. After sales service becomes a lot easier - broken device? Here's a replacement. No fiddling with colors / storage. Repairs should be easier too as shops need to source parts for one device.  

Besides the above, I think the device is very well priced, and Google have a real chance to get the Pixel name engrained into people's minds. The excellent camera should help as well."
GooglePixel,How reliant are you on the Pixel fingerprint scanner? Is the absence of it on the 4 a deal breaker for you?,"I use the fingerprint scanner at least 100x a day, not just to unlock but to authenticate my password manager, login to secure apps, approve purchases in Google Play Store, etc. 

Matter of fact, every app that accepts login with fingerprint, I have it turned on.  It's ESSENTIAL to my speedy workflow and very ergonomically placed.  Always right there an inch away from my finger, and the haptic feedback is also very comforting when it accepts.  It was a game changer for me when I first got the Pixel 2.

So, rumor has it Google will be using face recognition to unlock.  Not only do I not trust the security of it but I don't want to have to hold my phone up in selfie mode every time I need to authenticate, if this is even an option.   And what if I don't want to authenticate something I launched by mistake - do I have to quickly cover my face??  

I'm so disappointed there will be no scanner on the Pixel 4. I can't imagine any other biometric being as easy and useful.  It's probably a deal breaker for me.

How about you?  Thoughts advice and sarcastic jabs welcome!"
GooglePixel,Google still thinks 3 years of updates provide a 'great experience' ahead of cutting off Pixel 3,
GooglePixel,[OPINION] Fingerprint readers are better on the back,"So the current rumors are stating that the Pixel 4 will have a fingerprint sensor underneath the glass like the S10. But while this tech is cool, I think this is a mistake. I love how comfortable it is to slide my phone out of my pocket and already have it unlocked because my finger naturally rests on the back without even having to look at the phone. Not to mention, you lose the gesture to pull down the notification tray! So yeah, I think front facing readers suck, but what do you guys think?

Edit: Wow! This thread blew up over night. Thanks for keeping it civil, guys. I think facial recognition + rear fingerprint scanner is the best."

GooglePixel,UPDATE: Google Permanently banned my account because their system didn't recognize that I returned my phones to them,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/) a few months ago. It details how Google banned my payments account because I returned some RMA pixel phones to them and their system didn't recognize the return. When I did a credit card charge back, they banned me. There was no appeal process

Luckily, the post got enough traction that /u/PixelCommunity manager reached out to me. He looked at my case files and agreed I was banned in error, and reversed the ban. He said Google was aware that some phone returns were not processing in the system properly. [\(Link to comment\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/ds51hy6/?context=3) 

Update to today, two things happened.

(1) Google's Dispute department is still fighting my charge back claim with me and my credit card. I've sent in all the tracking numbers, RMA numbers, and have had to explain the issue in writing a few times. 

(2) This evening, I got an email saying my payments account is banned (again) because of a charge back and possible 'fraud'. I did not do any other charge backs, the ban is because of the same charge back from before. I can't make purchases, use android pay, google books, music, youtube red. I still have a gift card balance that I can't get back. 

To be honest, I'm really tired of dealing with this. I kept (and paid for) ONE Pixel 2XL. I tried with many, many calls last time and I couldn't get the ban reversed myself. At this point, maybe I should just make a brand new account, using the old one for email only (I still have email and photos unlocked). This has been going on since December. I just hope I win the credit card dispute soon so I can quit worrying about this. 

Edit: BTW, I think I figured out why they think I never returned the device. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/84sysx/update_google_permanently_banned_my_account/dvs96vr/)"

edit: this kinda blew up... see a couple things. phone was in my front pocket and the other side had my wallet and keys kept my hands on my pocket for most of the night and double checking it was in there.

I did buy the preferred care not sure if that's the same as the protection thing most people are saying. also used the Google synchrony finance thing. should have just used my capital one card. basically out 1000$ and still have to pay it without having the phone.

also I did try to use the find my phone for about 3 hours just refreshing... long night... ended up doing that secure phone option and did the erase my data. have all my work stuff on there and have my gpay card. also I do have fingerprint on and pin with 2fa on.

Second update... 11-01. went to lost and found just to get peace of mind... nothing... phone was fully charged so no reason for it to be off... obviously someone turned it off. checking find my phone still. changed my passwords to everything i own. paranoid as fuck thinking someone is on my account. someone suggested to ask a credit card company.... I actually bought the phone through the google finance store. but my plan is under my Dads Family Plan. he uses BofA Credit Card. he is a preferred member as well. so i guess they said since he pays the phone bill with his credit card and my phone is under that Plan that i have to file a claim and they will see if they can help. worth a shot. but if not just gonna pay the minimum every month and get another one... might just go to best buy and buy the 128gb... i had the 256gb. so 2000$ for a lesser version of the one i had....

Or actually talk about how they like them. My p6 has been great. FPS flawless from day one. How fast does it charge? Don't care. I charge it when I'm asleep. What a concept. The battery lasts me all day and I don't use adaptive. A12 is what it is. It's give and take. I use Nova and it works great. I don't have a phobia about large clock numbers. The only thing I had a problem with was Assistant ghost dialing people and that has gotten better. I'm far from a pixel fanboy.  This is my first one after over a decade of iOS. I have used some Android tablets over the years though. I have yet to encounter another pixel owner out in the wild but I'm interested to see if it's as widespread as it is in these subs.


Edit: Good to see so many people having a (mostly) positive experience. Yes I do occasionally see a post about someone enjoying their new phone but they usually get little to no reaction. I don't really care what phone people use. At the same time strong sales mean Google will continue to make phones. I think it's good to have options besides Apple and Samsung so yea I guess I am promoting the Pixel 6/Pro."
GooglePixel,Big-time tech YouTubers are annoying sometimes,I just watched MKBHD's Note 10 review and was baffled when he praised its battery life for having a 4½ hr SOT.

It's inconsistencies such as this that brings so much negativity towards the Pixel 4. Especially coming from an influencer with a very wide audience.

GooglePixel,Pixel 5 is $699 in the US because of mmWave.,I'm not saying blame Verizon on the $699 Pixel 5 price but i'm pretty sure it's that much because they require mmWave in there phones. The Verizon 4a 5G is $599. [https://www.verizon.com/about/news/pixel-preorders](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/pixel-preorders) $100 more just for mmWave. Some international Pixel 5's don't have mmWave so that explains why some of them are about $100 less then the US model. They should have launched a non-mmWave model for $599 in the US.

I've always been the type of person who wants to upgrade to the latest and greatest phones whenever I can but this time around I can see myself keeping this phone for the next 5 years. Everything about the Pixel 6 Pro is so nice and refreshing hardware wise to the point where I just don't see myself getting that itch for a new phone anytime soon."
GooglePixel,Ever wonder what a Google Pixel 6 Pro looks like after being run over by a lawn mower?,"My wife's phone fell out of her pocket while mowing.

GooglePixel,My pixelbook go just got me promoted!,So I work for a gas plant as a security and safety manager and for the longest time I wanted to record the training sessions I received so I could do the same for my team but always got my request denied for some reason and my GM kept asking if there's another way but my work account is heavily controlled by corporate.. Until the update where I was able to record my screen on my pixelbook go... It just made my job soo much easier and I was able to host multiple training sessions for my team to the point where we actually won an award which lead me to get a promotion and hefty pay bump. I'm so thankful for Google and their awesome service 🌹
GooglePixel,"I just missed my flight with the help if the silent alarm ""feature"" [x-post from r/android]","I can't imagine this hasn't happened before.... but this just happened to me:

I had a flight at 06:00 GMT today.

Yesterday I diligently set my alarm to 03:30 and my dear Pixel 2 told me it would wake me in 6 hours. 

I woke up several times just to check the time: 23:13, 00:18, 01:20, 02:10. The fifth time I checked, my phone displayed 07:19 and ""missed alarm 03:30""

I was confused to say the least... After digging around in my phone I found out that my alarm volume had been set to silent. I could have done this myself or one of my three kids sometime they were watching YouTube on my phone but nonetheless.. 

I find it mind boggling that no developer, product manager, tester, etc.. thought it was a bad idea to allow users to silence their alarms for the unseeable future and not show a notification of some sorts when they set their next alarm.



Since then, I've punched the air a couple times, laughed manically and found another flight."
GooglePixel,Anyone else's pixel 6 pro just working with zero/minimal problems?,"Think I saw a post last time about how it's only people with p6 problem posts here. But does anyone have a nice experience with the phone?

GooglePixel,"The Google Pixel 3 ""scratches"" on the back glass are NOT permanent and will go away immediately.","I went into a Verizon store yesterday with the intention of vandalizing their display Pixel 3s. The white and pink models didn't visibly scratch easily at all, and the black pixel scratched with a dime but the scratches themselves go away by just holding the phone in your hand.

I did this because I saw people complaining about permanent damage basically out of the box, and I didn't believe it. So now we see that these scratches are cosmetic and literally take no effort whatsoever to wipe away. They are NOT permanent scratching to the ""inferior glass backing"" where Gorilla Glass 5 or whatever would fix, they're not permanent at all.

Your fingernail won't normally leave a mark at all but if you push hard you can make a streak with your nail against the glass, again it wipes away immediately.

GooglePixel,Why I'm not pre-ordering the Pixel 4,Google will lower the price two weeks after it comes out and throw in a microwave with Google assistant for good measure.  History has shown their colors.
GooglePixel,Don't get the Pixel 6 Pro they said,"I finally got one after being hyped for the launch and completely destroyed and in the middle after reviews. I held off apparently I got mine during the perfect time. This thing has been flawless down to my cellular signal. I'm amazed at what Tensor can do with my usage it really is adjusting quite well. Android 12 isn't bad IMHO. So much hate and useless banter that will never see light beyond this subreddit. Frick you guys for scaring poor suckers like me away from such a fantastic experience. Maybe just maybe the user is the issue from heat horror stories coming from poorly optimized apps to not quite understanding the cellular transition that's going on everywhere. One hiccup and it's RMA season. In the end get the phone you want.

EDIT: Your definition and my definition of a solid working phone may not be the same. Even with a few bugs or dropped calls the phone is absolutely fine. Go enjoy life."
GooglePixel,LPT: Is your USB-C port getting loose? Get a toothpick and clean the lint out from it,"I've been having an issue with my Pixel 2's USB C port getting loose. I thought the metals had worn out and stopped gripping as strongly as they used to. Then, I decided to clean out the USB port. Holy hell. There was so much lint, and it completely fixed the issue for me.

Edit: The best way to do this is by using the toothpick end of a plastic flosser, which are thin enough to fit and won't damage anything. Remember to scratch on the outer part of the connector and trying to be careful with the strip in the middle (as that's where the data pins are). You want to focus on the bottom of the port, as that's where most of the lint will be, and it will probably be tightly packed, which is why compressed air may not help."
GooglePixel,Pixel 5 impressions after a week coming from a Pixel 2,"Things I like about the Pixel 5 which it has in common with the Pixel 2

* The relatively compact size, so I can easily carry it in a pocket or use it with one hand.
* The metal back with a slightly rough plasticised coating, which I think is a much underrated feature.
* The fingerprint sensor on the back. Why would you put it anywhere else?
* Stock, or nearly stock, Android. I don’t want to have to deal with Samsung software.
* Water resistance.
* I haven’t been able to test out the camera much, but the camera on the Pixel 2 was really good and if the camera on the Pixel 5 is at least as good, and every indication is that it is, I will be happy. The Pixel 5 adds a wide angle lens of course.

Standout features of the Pixel 5

* It’s full of screen. The bezels are impressively thin and symmetrical. The punch hole camera on the front is not obnoxious, hides in the status bar and doesn’t interfere with videos. The high refresh rate is nice to have.
* It’s full of battery. Working from home and using a dark theme, I’ve been getting about two days from it.

Other comments

* Wireless charging is nice to have. I’ve bought myself an Anker 15W charger (the phone itself charges wirelessly at a maximum of 12W).
* The Pixel 2 was fast enough for my needs, so the Pixel 5 is more than fast enough. 8Gb of RAM is nice to have I suppose.
* The Pixel 5 should get three years of updates, whereas the Pixel 2 is coming to the end of support.
* I’ve not been able to test 5G yet.

Minor quibbles

* The fingerprint sensor isn’t very recessed.
* Squeeze to assist is gone.
* The top under-screen speaker is a bit tinny.
* The haptics feel a bit unrefined.
* ~~The Pixel 5 is not yet Android Enterprise certified, which means I still have to use my old phone for work email.~~ Edit: as of 29 Oct 20, the Pixel 5 is now Android Enterprise certified, so I can access my work email.

In short, the upgrade was worth it to me, I hope this is useful.

GooglePixel,Dear Google: Sick of indefinite waits for products outside the US. Please lift your game...,"Title says what I wanna say. Apple launches products globally - or if it doesn't, it gives its customers launch dates / windows for different countries. I'm in Australia. I've been waiting over 6 months now for the launch of these Pixel Buds, just like everyone else. The least you could do is give us an estimated launch date. 

I get that there might be supply-chain disruptions at the moment, but that hasn't been the issue in the past when you've chosen to make your non-US customers a far lower priority for hardware launches. Based on similar launches, it seems like your model is to supply the US first, then make stock available elsewhere as US demand slows, or you get a better sense of how the product is landing.

GooglePixel,I can never go back to non-Pixel phones thanks to the camera,"I'm a long-time Android user: I got the HTC Droid Incredible II in 2010, and have stayed with Android ever since. Recently, I had been using the Moto G line of phones, which were perfectly acceptable phones for a good price.

But the camera on the Pixel 4 has blown me away. It has me taking many more photos and much better photos, which is really important to me right now with a toddler. The computational photography makes a great photo almost every time, and keeping these memories is the most important thing I need out of a phone right now.

GooglePixel,I love the back button,"If anyone from Google reads these posts: Please, for the love of all that is holy, leave the back button alone!

I just read an article that the back button might disappear from the next Android release. Personally, I don't like gesture navigation, and I'll be incredibly angry (and avoid updating) if the back button is removed. I'm a huge fan of giving people the option to choose between gesture and normal navigation, but I hope Google doesn't try to force everyone to use gestures. Sadly, it seems a lot of the more recent Android changes have been all about removing the ability to choose and customize...

Why would I ever want to have to make a sweeping gesture to do something when I can make a simple tap? The back button is a beautiful thing, and I absolutely hate using phones without it (most of my family are a bunch of quitters and have iPhones). Even if I'm in the minority, I'm sure that--at the very least--people with arthritis would agree. "

GooglePixel,Disappointed in the size of the Pixel 6?,"Who else is disappointed that the smaller pixel 6 will feature a 6.4"" display and a sizeable jump from the pixel 5 (and really, all other ""regular"" pixels) before? I realize this isn't the first time this had been discussed, but figured to see where everyone's heads are at. I realize many in the pixel world these days prefer the larger devices anyway.

Don't get me wrong, i really like what the company is doing with the tech itself, i just don't understand why we have to have such a large base model. The smaller form factor has been a key motivator for me in pixels for so long and i just can't hide my disappointment when it goes away. It's been nice to not get handcuffed features in a smaller device like others have done, and to have the other of the ""a* variants if we wanted to.

Anyway, trying to still see the positives here, which is that this is shaping up to be a really dope overall device that I'll almost definitely be preordering. But losing the telephoto upgrade and still having a significantly larger device than before... It's hitting me in the feels right now. I don't want to buy bigger pockets..."

Hello,

You may remember me from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ir1qne/just_fyi_i_was_able_to_warranty_rma_my_pixel_buds/) in which I said it had been ""hassle-free"" to warranty my defective Pixel Buds.

Lol no.

I sent the Pixel Buds back at the beginning of September. After 3 weeks went by without getting my money back, I started sending an email once per week to request an update on the status of the refund. All of these were ignored.

I reached out to Pixel Buds support via chat to find out why. Rep Harry told me that they had received my Pixel Buds, but could not return my money. When I asked how that wasn't just stealing, he disconnected.

I started another chat with Ivan, who said Harry was just incompetent and didn't know what he was talking about. My refund would be forthcoming. I asked him to confirm this in an email to me because I wanted it in writing. He wouldn't go that far, no matter how much I insisted, but he did send me an RMA number and told me the refund request was still active.

I have been communicating ever since with both Ivan and Harry via email, each of whom tells me different things. Now there's a Kylie involved too. All promise to consult with ""specialists"" to figure out how best to resolve this issue. It seems pretty straight-forward to me: I have returned my defective Pixel Buds, and now you return my money.

/u/PixelCommunity, if you still monitor this subreddit, this has been a truly deranged Kafkaesque nightmare of a customer service experience, ranking below even my past dealings with Comcast.

I've bought two Pixel phones and had planned to buy more in the future. Why is Google treating me like such a sack of garbage?


**EDIT:** Pitchforks down! My money has been returned!

I just scrolled through my bank account transaction history to find that my money was returned on Oct. 22.
Now, I certainly feel like an idiot, BUT in my defense:

I received NO notification through Google Pay or from anyone at Google that my refund had been processed.
The customer service chats I had with Harry and Ivan, in which I was told, first, that my money *could not* be returned, and then, second, that it *would* be returned, took place on **Oct. 26.**

In all of the emails I have exchanged with them since then, my RMA status has been referred to as ""active."" There is no record of the money being returned in my Google Pay account. I had to find it scrolling through my bank app.

I still feel foolish and am sorry for riling you all up, but this remains, in my opinion, a colossal customer service failure. Thanks /u/dmziggy for your willingness to help. I'll respond below and to your ticket to let you know to abort the escalation process.

GooglePixel,My experience so far with the Pixel 5 coming from a Pixel 3,"I haven't even had the phone for 24 hours yet so keep that in mind - these are very early impressions! Just thought I'd compare directly with my Pixel 3 whilst I still can, as I'll probably be trading the older phone in this weekend.

Let's get this out of the way first. The bad:

* Speakers are not as good as Pixel 3's front firers. They're tinnier, less punchy, and the stereo effect is more imbalanced towards the bottom speaker when holding the phone in landscape. They're serviceable for casual YouTubing and phonecalls/podcasts but don't try and seriously play music on them. No crackle or distortion but just a notable downgrade vs Pixel 3. So far this is definitely the phone's Achilles heel.

* Photos take a little longer (by a second or two) to process vs Pixel 3 due to no dedicated visual core. Not a huge difference by any means, but it's there.

* Black smearing is still here at low brightness levels, albeit not as bad as on Pixel 3.


Now for the more encouraging part! The good:

* Display is a **monumental** upgrade over Pixel 3. I'll prove it - see [Pixel 3 here](https://i.imgur.com/jC6wMTo.jpg), and then [Pixel 5 here](https://i.imgur.com/OmCs8cs.jpg). Both phones were locked to 25% brightness. They both had the exact same image on the display (ignore the purple tint on the Pixel 5, that was just the camera struggling with the very low light conditions). You can't see anything in the Pixel 3 photo because it doesn't display the grey squares at all at that brightness level, everything is crushed into black nothingness. I have to crank Pixel 3 brightness to 35% to match Pixel 5's display at 0% to get the grey squares to the same level of visibility on both screens - that's a huge improvement for the new phone! ([Here's the link to the image with grey squares if you want to test it out on your phone](https://i.imgur.com/bWPsANV.jpg)).

* Performance seems smooth so far, navigating the UI is nice and fluent, animations look fluid. Apps launch quickly, phone feels snappy so far. I've logged into all the usual apps I had on Pixel 3 including known resource hogs (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Amazon for example). 90Hz provides a noticeable boost to scrolling vs 60Hz. Pixel 5 definitely keeps many more apps in memory than Pixel 3.

* The aesthetic of the small, symmetrical bezels is really good! [Looks much more 'modern' than my Pixel 3.](https://i.imgur.com/FIfpXSf.jpg) Quite the stunner.

* Battery life so far seems to be much better than Pixel 3 - I can't say that much yet because obviously it's very early days, haven't got a full day from it yet. But I can already see it drains much less per hour than the Pixel 3 in active use. Standby also seems better so far - 0% drain overnight (with no AOD).

* Call quality is fine. I tested it with my brother. He sounded a bit more 'distant' than with my Pixel 3 but I could still make out his every word clearly (and my mum making random comments in the background from time to time haha). He did say that I sounded much better on his end vs my Pixel 3 (everyone has always complained about the quality of my voice from my Pixel 3 microphones).

* Haptics are a bit better than Pixel 3. Tighter, more refined. If that makes sense? More precise, like iPhone haptics and less coarse rattling of the whole phone. It's hard to put into words. I prefer Pixel 5 haptics, that's what I'm saying.

* Video is better on Pixel 5. 4K 60fps video is definitely nicer looking than Pixel 3's 4K 30fps. Haven't had much opportunity to properly test it out yet though. Same story story with ultrawide lens - looks fine at first impressions, haven't had opportunity to test it thoroughly yet though. Need more time to assess these new features.

* Main sensor photos appear fine. Not much different from Pixel 3 to be honest, I can see a bit more detail when zooming into an image and the slightly wider aperture seems to help to capture a bit more light in dark indoor conditions. It's not a big difference though, I imagine most of these improvements were applicable to last year's Pixel 4 too. But still, it's the same great camera experience as always. [Here's a completely unedited photo of my fish that wouldn't stay still.](https://i.imgur.com/y559ZYk.jpg)

* The fabric case is quite nice honestly. Nice grippy texture. Green Chameleon colour really melds well with the Sage model!

That's probably enough for now (this has already evolved into a wall of text, oops). Overall, I am liking what I'm seeing so far. I'll of course keep sharing my findings as I use the phone more. Any questions I'll answer to the best of my ability.

Hope this proves interesting to someone out there! 🙂"

GooglePixel,Am I the only one who wants a small Pixel?,"After my Pixel 5 bricked I switched to the 6a and while I enjoy Pixel smartphones a lot in general (besides their terrible customer service), they’re just too big and uncomfortable for my liking… and the Pixel 8 looks to be the more or less the same size as the 6a. I recently bought an iPhone 13 Mini as a secondary phone as it’s literally the only small ""flagship“ device available today. I love the size (I think it’s 5.4 inches compared to the 6 inches of the Pixel 5), it’s literally perfect. Battery life is for my usage with 4h-5h SOT more than enough considering its size, I don’t want to spend more time on my phone during a day anyway. However, an iPhone could never become my primary device for multiple reasons (no hate) and I sincerely wish Google would make a Pixel with the same (or similar) size. Am I alone or are we just such a tiny minority? What do you think will the future for smaller Pixel or Android phones look like? Shout out to everyone whose Pixel 5 is still going strong! Best Pixel ever (imo)

Edit: Thanks for all the thoughts! Asus Zenfone is unfortunately not available at my carrier in Germany, only Samsung, Apple, Google, Sony and Xiaomi as far as I remember. The 2 years support would be a deal breaker to me as well since I want to keep my phone for more than two years and still enjoy a few new things. Anyway, hope everyone enjoys their device and thanks for sharing your sentiments!"

GooglePixel,Pixel 5 and 4a 5g full specs leaked,
GooglePixel,"I feel like Google has ruined my phone (original Pixel) with each additional ""update"". Warning: Rant","I'm frustrated with Google. In fact, I'm not sure I will ever buy another Google phone after my experience with my current Pixel 1.

I realize my phone is several years old. Google was kind enough to remind me of that when I submitted a help request. Fuck me for wanting to hold onto a phone I spent several hundred dollars on for a couple of years, I know.

The pixel started off as a great phone. Snappy, took good pictures, I enjoyed its seamless integration with backing up photo's to Google's cloud, the fingerprint sensor was nearly flawless, good form factor, etc.

Last year, I noticed I was starting to miss a lot of calls. I figured I was just being inattentive, or forgetting to turn on my ringer. After several months/maybe a year of thinking I was crazy, I definitively noticed one day that my phone was on full volume and I missed a call while my phone was <1 ft from me. I googled it and what do you know, a lot of people complaining that a recent update left them with seemingly random loss of ringing when receiving a call. Such a basic, fundamental aspect of the phone, now called into question.

And then today I had the most frustrating bug I have ever experienced. TWO alarms set on my phone, neither of which went off. I double-checked everything - alarm volume is up, alarms were actively set and for the proper day, AM and not PM, etc. No missed alarm notificaiton. Everything is right. I google it, and what do you know.. other people complaining of the same thing.

This is such basic shit to work on a phone, and yet when I emailed Google inquiring about a fix, the first thing the rep says to me is... the Pixel is X years old and the current Pixel 3 would be a great upgrade. Gee, thanks, I would love to spend $800 on a new phone to make sure it rings when someone calls me.

Anyway, I just felt the need to rant. I'm annoyed that such basic functions of a phone are now being called into question due to 'updates' over the years. What good is a phone if it doesn't friggen RING when someone calls? And thank you, Google, for that extremely helpful suggestion to fix the problem by sending you more money. Always a useful recommendation indeed.


******************************************************

Edit - this blew up more than I thought it would. Some things to add/worth pointing out

1) I have done a factory reset of the phone. Didn't help, unfortunately.

2) Interesting to note how many people are commenting below about how they're also missing calls and never noticed. How very interesting indeed.... which leads me into my third point

3) The few (very few, fortunately) people who have aggressively called me out for making this up, pretending there are no issues, demanding my app list and then getting upset I didn't respond an hour later.. First of all, I don't care if you're a google fanboi and are upset by this post. In fact, I'm laughing at you because I find it hilarious someone feels the need to defend Google or any phone manufacturer. Secondly, read this thread and see how many other people are suddenly realize they're missing calls as well. I guess we're all just fucking up our phones with candy crush! But I digress.

4) When I miss a call, I've noticed the phone is still receiving the call, but the screen doesn't really turn on and it doesn't ring. So, I don't think it's a network issue for that reason."

GooglePixel,"It's 2019, why does it cost $100 to go from 64gb to 128gb on a phone?","Current prices of storage are dirt cheap, why are prices so high to upgrade?

I can't believe I'm writing that Apple has better pricing for anything tech related, but Apple lets you upgrade from 64gb to 128gb for $50 and from 64gb to 256gb for $150 on the iPhone XR. Pricing is similar for the iPhone XS, upgrading from 64gb to 256 is $150 and for 64gb to 512gb is $350.

GooglePixel,Android 10s dark mode is still half-baked,"There is still a bunch of native Google apps that just don't go dark when turning on dark mode. I feel like that should be the least they need to be able to pull off (using a Pixel 3 XL btw).

Specifically, these native apps don't (automatically) go dark for me:
* messages
* app store
* keyboard (super frustrating)
* Gmail
* YouTube
* Google Maps
* Translate
* Podcasts
* Play Music

Two more thoughts:
1. In many apps, it's _way_ too complicated to actually get to the dark mode setting. It should be a simple switch on the first options level.
2. Hardly any third-party apps manage to pull of the transition. Reddit, for instance, does. There should be so many more. I mean, how hard can it possibly be!? Apple manages to do it so I feel like at least the Pixel lineup should as well."
GooglePixel,"Have had my Pixel 3a XL for less than 24 hours, Here's some Surprises and Thoughts","\- Build does not feel cheap at all. Feels very similar to the Pixel 2 XL Panda feel. Feels well built. Back has that frosted feeling to it. 

\- OLED screen is really good for a sub $500 phone

\- Stereo Speakers are really good. I like them better than the Pixel 3 XL's. Might not get quite as loud but sound very clear and not as much vibration as the 3XL's. These don't feel like budget speakers.

\- Haptic Feedback is great. I was expecting cheap feeling haptics, maybe tinny feeling but this feels very similar to the 3XL. Came from a Note 9 and its as good or better feeling that the note 9.

\- Size is perfect. Note 9 was too tall for me. 

\- Weight, its lighter but not cheap feeling. With a old 3XL case on it(fits pretty close until I get a proper case) it has the right weight. 

\- Headphone Jack audio sounds very good, similar to the Note 9. Not an audiophile tho so don't quote me but its sounds like the same quality other flagships have.

\- Phone feels fast. Might open apps a little slower than a flagship but its not ""as slow as crap"" like some are saying. I'm sure its not as fast at gaming but its definitely fast for my use case(music, YT, Social Media, Reddit, Chrome, etc)

\- Camera, Awesome, not slow at capturing(HDR processing in the background is a little slower but not really slow or much different). So glad to have a Pixel camera again, the Note 9 is nice and all but taking photos of moving subjects and in lower light conditions is not its best features. 

\- Battery Life, so far hard to tell but seems as good as the note 9 or in between it and the Pixel 3 XL.

\- Buttons, feel well made and durable. Nice clicky buttons. 

\- fingerprint Scanner is great.

I am very happy with this phone. I'm really kinda single handedly blown away by how much google fit in this package. They really only skimped on the processor which seems great for my needs to far. I think people are bashing this phone too much when they have no experience actually using it yet. Yes its missing features but things needed cut for the price, and yes I understand you can get some flagships discounted close to this price but this phone is wonderful. I wholeheartedly recommend it so far. I was really on the fence yesterday driving to Best Buy. I was thinking I would regret it. But its the opposite. I'm so glad I did. The Note 9 is wonderful and everything but it just has too many features that get in its own way. Plus I just wanted the best camera on a smartphone and that's the Pixel 3a/3/3xl. Price is such a great value especially at $479 + $100 bonus bringing it to $379.

At my University, there were some students (at least they looked like students) who were using what definitely looked like Pixel 4 XLs to get facial identification from passing students to send back to, you guessed it--Google!

As a Google fanatic and being in this subreddit, seeing the square cutout camera bump was a shock and I had to check out what was going on. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but the guy declined to answer anything pertaining the device itself. I also asked to take pictures, but he said that he ""preferred I not"" so bummer. He did tell me that he was commissioned by Google but not directly working for them and was told to give out $5 Starbucks gift cards to entice people to scan their faces to send to Google for Face ID (whatever it'll be called) improvements.

* The device looks exactly like the leaks confirmed. Noticeable top band but pretty tiny chin, the phone was enclosed in this metallic cage that only really let out the bottom with a bottom firing speaker(s?) and the back camera bump that had two cameras, a flash at the bottom, and a small cutout on the top probably for the laser autofocus. It was also a black bumper with a white backing, so panda 4/XL is confirmed for sure!
* The process for scanning was different from the leaks that we've seen. It was no cute little head animation, it showed a bunch of dots that he asked me to follow with my nose in a rotational pattern. Honestly, I was in shock that I was even holding the damn thing so I did a sloppy job but he didn't really seem to mind. Then, he asked me to put it to my side, like how you hold your phone casually while walking, and then brought it back up to my face and asked me to tap the volume key, which was where my thumb naturally rested. I do have bigger than normal hands, so I'm not sure how this will pan out for your perspectives. This bringing down to the side and back up went on for a few times, each time something different. He asked me to cover my left eye, right eye, then nose with my hand, and the last time asked me to just close my left eye, then right, then both.

\- - - - -

Even though I couldn't access anything other than that specific settings screen, there were some things I wanted to test out.

\- - - - - 

* 90 hertz screen didn't seem to be on because side by side with my Pixel 3 there wasn't any difference, but I assume this is a setting that we have to manually change ourselves.
* Haptic feedback was actually pretty odd. It isn't as prominent as in the Pixel 3/3 XL, but it still felt firm. A much gentler haptic feedback but improvements nonetheless. I felt the Pixel 3's haptic feedback could get a little wonky at times.
* Screen quality looked really nice. It was a white background and I inspected the phone for any blue tint, put it in direct sunlight and it was still bright and visible. I could barely see the cutouts for flood illuminator/IR cameras, but the soli chip is quite visible in direct sunlight at the top right. Speaker earpiece is also considerably smaller as well. Something else to note is the dynamic range was pretty good for the front facing camera, which I HEAVILY inspected while scanning my acne covered face.

That pretty much concludes my 5 minutes with what I can confidently say was the Pixel 4 XL. I nerded out so hard and the guy was trying really hard not to say anything about it but he could tell that I definitely knew wassup. Please feel free to ask any other questions; I'd be happy to try to answer them! I know we already have videos and leaks, but I'm a nobody on the internet who actually got to hold one without jumping through hoops and it excites me that I can actually contribute to the Pixel 4 leak squad 🥰

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the navigation bar was the 3 button layout. Clever move for Google to not expose themselves, but it also does hint that we could be able to switch between the 3, pill, and bar gesture system. Also formatting and spelling edits. (I only mention this because when the Pixel 3 came out, it wasn't until Android 10 that we were able to change the nav bar layout)

GooglePixel,"Another Thanksgiving, another year of spending 20 minutes figuring out how to give and get photos from relatives with iPhones","I'm so annoyed as per usual with sharing photos between iPhones and my Pixel. Family members spent all day taking photos of us cooking, the kids playing football, and all other kinds of fun. But I won't get access to any of those because I'm not part of the iMessage text chain that they all share. 

I posed with a few family members for a photo and it was taken with an iPhone 13. I then asked if we could also take it on my phone so I didn't have to deal with trying to get the photo in full quality. ""Oh wow,"" they say, looking at my photo, ""yours is so much warmer and looks a lot better.""

Thank you. I know. It's why I bought my Pixel 3. 

I also took a selfie at the dinner table, with my wide angle selfie lens. It took 10 minutes of working with my tech-savvy cousin to figure out how to download the photo from a Google Photos link onto their iPhone. They asked me to text it to them but I refused because I knew it would compress it to oblivion through SMS, prompting more ""you have an Android"" comments.

An hour later after after the photo was downloaded through Google Photos and my cousin forwarded it to the family iMessage chat, I got lots of compliments about the photo. Mostly surprised at how good the quality was, but also thankful that my selfie was able to get all of the food and people in one shot. ""You did a good job with this photo!"" and ""Oh wow your Android photo isn't pixelated! Wow!""

Thank you. I know. It's why I bought my Pixel 3. 

On top of all of that, I know this could be easily fixed by Apple implementing RCS into it's iMessage app. Then I could just text everyone the photos at full resolution. Better yet, I could even be a part of the group chat. But Apple refuses to play fair. 

Whatever. I'm just annoyed. Three years ago, I bought my phone for half the price of an iPhone, and it still consistently takes shots that are competitive with, and often even better than, the iPhone 13. 

And I'm still suck at family gatherings trying to share photos. 

TL;DR: Thanksgiving was fun but it's still ridiculously complicated to share my high-quality Pixel 3 photos with my relatives. After figuring out how to do so, they complimented me on my photos.

Edit: wording for clarity.

Edit 2: thank you for all your suggestions. Sending a Google Photos link works great for Android but downloading them on iOS is complicated. If you hit Download All, it downloads a zip file (""what is a ZIP file?""). After that, they need to go into the files app and click unzip, and then they need to import to camera roll for some reason (even though the photos are already on the phone?!). Also, for whatever reason, my cousin tried to download the photos both individually and as a zip on their phone. It just led to a blank white screen. So... It's a process, trying to get people on iOS to download from a Google Photos link. And that doesn't even consider trying to get photos from them."

GooglePixel,Had an emergency - Pixel 6a would not dial 000.," 4 Week old Pixel 6a.  


Just found an unresponsive man passed out next to his vehicle.  


When I tried to dial 000 the phone displayed my location and did nothing else, there was no ringtone and it never connected to emergency services (see screenshot). I had to run 2 minutes down the road to find help from someone with a functioning phone.  
The time I spent looking for someone instead of performing CPR may of contributed to this mans passing.   


In all honesty this is absolutely shocking, at bare minimum a phone should be able to dial for emergency services. Even testing now I get the same issue. This is really scary! If this had been someone I cared about I would be absolutely beside myself and would never forgive Google. This bug needs to be brought to public attention right now and resolved ASAP!"
GooglePixel,Google Assistant making reservations on Pixel is now active! I tried it.,"I used the Google Assistant option on Google maps to get a reservation at a BBQ joint. Here's what happened. (Pixel 3 on Android 10. USA)

- It warned me the location wasn't open yet, but it will try anyway. 
- It reported back the location didn't answer and it will try when they open. 
- Exactly at opening time it called and tried to get me a reservation, reporting back the location didn't take reservations. This also removed the option on Google maps with a note (this location doesn't accept reservations).

Here's what is cool.
I spoke to workers when I arrived asking who took the call from the guy who asked for a reservation for two at opening time. The owner said she took the call. I told her that was not a person, but my Google Assistant. She laughed and didn't believe me. Then I explained further. She swore she was talking to a real person. 

Amazing. Can't wait to actually book a successful reservation and see how everything works. Has anyone else messed with it?"

GooglePixel,New Pixel 6 info from Max Weinbach,"Max Weinbach was in a [podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9ENldPM25kcg/episode/MWNiNWJlYjAtNDEzZi00OTdjLTliYTUtNTYwYzQ2YzYzNjE3?ep=14) talking about I/O and the recent Pixel 6 leaks, and he dropped some new info about the Pixel 5a and 6.

In case you didn't know, Max Weinbach is a pretty reliable leaker, with a good track-record, trusted by multiple people in the industry, such as 9to5google. Though it's important to keep in mind that these are still not 100% confirmed, especially since they are not from tweets or articles, but a conversation in a podcast.

So here are every new juicy things Max said:

\-25:50 Pixel 5a will be more expensive than Pixel 4a (that was probably to be expected since it's basically a 4a 5G from what we've seen from previous leaks).

\-13:10 Pixel Watch to be powered by 5 nm Samsung chip, not Qualcomm.

\-16:40 Pixel Watch and Pixel 6 to launch in October, except if there's chip shortage which would result in a November launch.

\-17:20 Pixel 6 SoC (Whitechapel) is ""an in-between 888 and 865"".

\-22:50 The main reason why Google will use Whitechapel instead of a Qualcomm SoC:

>AI, they can do their own custom NPUs. The ISP in there is custom-designed. Their camera sensors are custom top of the line sensors.

\-23:50 Bigger Pixel 6 would be 120Hz QHD with 5000 mAh.

\-23:50 Smaller Pixel 6 would be 120Hz FHD and it seems he was less certain about that but assumed around 4500 mAh.

\-39:00 One Pixel 6 color scheme is constituted of a peach color at the top and a sand color (like the Not Pink of the Pixel 3) at the bottom with a gold body.

\-39:20 There will be a green Pixel 6 (he doesn't know what the specific colors are).

\-41:40 Pixel 6 marketing budget on the level of a Samsung Galaxy S-series device. Google is willing to spend money on this phone.

\-43:10 The camera design in the form of a bar that we've seen is going to be the design language of future Pixel phones because it's a future-proof design thanks to all the room it gives to allow new camera tech.

GooglePixel,Anyone else let down by the Pixel line this year and considering an iPhone?,"Here come the downvotes! But actually, I can't be the only one let down by the Pixel line in recent years, right?

I've tried other Android manufacturers over the years and have always been let down by their skinned OS/update timeliness, which has always lead me to be loyal to the Nexus/Pixel line for 8+ years (currently own a Pixel 3).

But the Pixel 4 was a let down and now what's shaping up to be the Pixel 5 also looks pretty weak (for the rumored price).

For the first time ever, I'm considering an iPhone which I thought I'd never do. Is anyone else feeling the same?

EDIT: I want to clarify, I love Android and *if* I end up switching there will definitely be things I will miss. But I'm tired of being a ""beta-tester"" for Google. I was fine when it was the Nexus line and things didn't work sometimes (both hardware and software) because it was positioned and priced for developers to tinker. **But the whole point of introducing the Pixel line was to be a competitive, consumer-ready flagship.** It was supposed to be the ""north star"" for all other Android manufacturers and an example of what a premium flagship Android device could be.

The first Pixel felt like that. But with every release since it feels it's slipping back to what the Nexus line was. Not that the Nexus line was bad, but it was positioned for a different purpose. And it makes it hard for consumers that want a premium, stock (e.i. clean) Android experience to justify the price for a phone that **requires** tweaking, RMAing, and compromising. "

GooglePixel,Went from iPhone 14 Plus to Pixel 6a...just wow....,"I've always had Pixels in the past, even Nexuses before that. I was gifted an iPhone 14 plus so I started using that after my Pixel 5. But during the black Friday sales the pixel 6a dropped so low in price that I was able to exchange my pixel 5 for a pixel 6a by just adding a tiny bit on top. So I thought I'd take the pixel 6a out for a spin....

This phone is an absolute bargain. My iPhone 14plus is around 1k$ in price and there is very little I can't do on the 6a that I can on the iPhone. That 700USD price difference is ridiculous. The frame rate on paper is higher on the iPhone but it lags heavily, the pixel 6a is so smoooooth. Also the camera is just incredible for this price. The software makes up for the lower spec hardware and magic eraser is the cherry on top. Apple simply cannot justify that price tag

Edit: getting unnecessary hate from Apple users over this post. saying the budget pixel was smoother than the iPhone (in my experience) shouldn't enrage someone on Reddit to the extent that you're personally attacking me :)

Re-edit: my god people are so angry :D I'd like to apologise to the Reddit community and in particular iPhone users, I genuinely thought the iPhone 14 plus had a higher frame rate. Next time i post, I will check the facts better :) BUT...I still stand by the fact that the phone itself is smoother with an incredibly lower price tag."

I am posting this here because /r/GooglePixel seems to have changed into a territory for haters of rooting and custom ROMs/Kernel. How ever, without root you will probably never figure this out.

So here I am posting this for everyone who is facing massive battery drain (like I did):

**ProxyHandler gets stuck after a reboot**

Basically every now and then the ""ProxyHandler"" will get stuck after a  reboot and prevent the phone from ever going into deep sleep.

Fix:

* To temporarily fix this go into airplane mode and reboot again.
* Disable  airplane mode after the reboot and use your phone until the next reboot

**When the screen gets stuck at 60Hz**

I wasn't able to figure out which service is keeping the device awake. But I did track down that the 60Hz stuck-issue is also prevent the phone to going into deep sleep.

Fix:

* Reboot the phone

&#x200B;

**Other notes regarding testing:**

In my testing it doesn't seem like ""Naptime"" will fix or help with any of the issues. Also in my testing it seems like ""Naptime"" in general doesn't do anything regarding battery drain / deep sleep.

Deep Sleep means that the phone will save a lot of battery while the screen is off. Usually the drain during deep sleep is 0,2-0,5%/h. Without deep sleep it is somewhere at 2-4%/h.

So far I have been using BBS to track down most of the issues.To use BBS on Android 12:

* Install BBS
* Grant all permissions
* Run in adb: adb shell settings put global hidden\_api\_policy 1
* Reboot phone
* Everything except kernel wakelocks will work

Hope this helps some people."
GooglePixel,Perhaps my biggest annoyance with Android 12 is how expanding lock screen notifications draws down the entire notification tray,"I love Android 12. I love my Pixel 6. But viewing notifications on the lock screen is a chore. Expending any notification will expand the notification tray. The notifications cannot be collapsed. The tray cannot be collapsed. Can you side swipe the notification tray away? Nope. And sliding up the notification tray does not, as one would think, collapse the notification tray. Nope, it brings up the pin code number pad.

All of this just because I want to expand a notification on the lock screen. And you might ask why don't I just press the power button after I'm done viewing a notification to go back into sleep mode when I'm done. To that I say, why should I? Back in Android 11, I was able to expand notifications from the lock screen without the tray being pulled down, avoiding this new annoyance. That should come back.

Such a simple and time saving task shouldn't take me this long to get used to. And it sure as hell shouldn't be this inconvenient to use.

Thank you kind redditor for the platinum award, you guys have made my day, really appreciate it! :)"
GooglePixel,I've taken more photos in the last 3 months since switching to Pixel 3 than the last 4 years of owning iPhones,"~880 pictures so far on my Pixel 3. My previous two phones were iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 which I used for about 4 years total and totaled ~400 pictures each. 

What I think Google got right was reducing the inhibitions of pulling out the phone to take a photo. Compared to my iPhones, I feel like I don't need to be deliberate when taking photos with Pixel 3. Things like not having to worry about storing the photos, means I'm not wasting time deleting bad photos as I take them. Also not having to look at the screen to open the camera app allows me to ready the camera without missing the moment with my own eyes. Rather than pulling out the camera only on special occasions, the Pixel justifies taking more photos of my surroundings and experimenting. It's a better user experience. "
GooglePixel,Idea: Pixel phones plugged to a monitor should enable chrome os,"On the example of Samsung a few years ago, integrating android and chrome os would demonstrate Google's leading position. The two OS share already so much, including the apps. The phone could then become the webcam, the microphone and speaker.
Imagine the professional use: in a hot desk set-up, employees come in the morning and have their pixel phone in their pocket. They choose a work space and plug the phone to the usb-c stand. On the available monitor, chrome os enterprise is booting up. Fully agile."
GooglePixel,Active edge squeeze is a highly underrated feature,"I've been using this feature a lot more lately and while it's pretty simple on paper, it makes for much slicker voice command use compared to other phones. I never really thought about it until I used it to identify a song at a bar the other day and blew my friends minds.

My friends with Iphones: ""Hey Siri"" while half the time this shit doesn't trigger their voice search and they sound like derps repeating ""HeY SiRi! HeY SiRi!"" over and over until it does. 

Me: *subtly squeeze the side of my phone*... ""What song is this""? Voice search registers on first try and result returned in seconds

Anyone else love this feature and use it the same or for anything else?"

GooglePixel,I HATE optical fingerprint sensors,"1) frequently BLINDS me at night when i pick the phone and i make the unholy mistake of not having my finger at exactly the right spot

GooglePixel,Pixel 2 XL Is Great For Chickens!,"For the millions of people out there who make smartphone purchases based on chicken-based features, this phone has a flashlight that is great for candling chicken eggs. We lost power to our coop and could not use the plug in light that we use to check the eggs, so we improvised and tried the phone flashlight. It works better than the device made for the purpose! This phone continues to have new and surprising features all the time. Love it.

-Edit- Adding the requested [pic](https://imgur.com/k6d1aYe) of an egg being candled. This one is one that was developing (as you can see by the dark area and the veiny lines) but that was rejected by the hen. Our chickens are new to this and are learning how to hatch eggs as they go, so while sad, it happens. They'll get the hang of it eventually!"
GooglePixel,Finally left the walled garden,"Hi everyone, my first post here

I finally made the switch from iPhone (a XS) to a Pixel 7, after waiting all these years for a Pixel that would appeal to me as mature enough. Well, this was the year (and the apple products price hikes just helped make the decision).

I have been full on apple for a decade, starting from my beloved 4S, macbook pro (2014), ipads etc... But I honestly became more and more alienated from this company in the last 3-4 years from a number of factors, such as the money grab at every chance (it's always been a thing with them, but it's getting ridiculous), the decay in design quality/care (software AND hardware, IMO), the phone camera picture ""style"" direction, the whole app store ""closeness"" and developers' relationship, and on and on.

I realized I started ditching most of their services in favour of google or microsoft alternatives (and because of my job as well), so the jump it has been surprisingly smooth, and after the first day with this Pixel 7 I am totally in love with the device in a way I haven't long felt with a tech product.

Reading this sub has been a pleasant company during the wait for the delivery, and a motivator to believe in the good quality of this device, hope I will enjoy the ride ahead with you all.

P.s. sold my old apple watch, and waiting for the Pixel watch coming in a couple of weeks as well :)"
GooglePixel,The Pixel's photo quality is still better than the iPhone's,"I just got Pixel 4a 5G today. I traded in my old 3a to T-Mobile and got the new one for free. I also got the iPhone 12 Pro Max a few weeks back, it's my daily driver. I took a few sample comparison pics and it's pretty clear that the Pixel's camera is much better. 

The iPhone's colors look off and it still can't get portrait mode right. This couldn't be any more clear than when I tried taking pictures of my new puppy. He moves around all the time and it's rare for him to hold still for more than a few seconds. The iPhone struggles with shutter speed, especially in portrait mode. Pixel? Works like a charm. With that said, the iPhone's 4K HDR video quality is utterly insane and its pictures admittedly are still good...just not as good as the Pixel's. 

I'll have to have my Pixel by me going forward for when I need to take some pics of the little guy.

Obligatory photo of the pupper: https://imgur.com/a/jlgpJCz

EDIT: Wow, this blew up! I was not expecting this, lots of great conversation going on. For those asking for a comparison, I don't have a 1:1 comparison because again, the puppy won't sit still for more than two seconds. Here's a good picture of him I took with my iPhone, in better lighting conditions: https://imgur.com/a/3f4BBYj

And thank you for all the puppy compliments! We love him very much, his name is Moshe and he's 11 weeks old. We just got him two weeks ago and I've probably taken more photos/videos in that two-week span than I have in all of 2020."
GooglePixel,The worst part about owning a Pixel 3: Constant Google Newsfeed stories and notifications about price drops,"I'm sure I'm not the only owner who did a TON of research on the Pixel 3 before I bought it (at launch! What a dolt)

Well, this clearly trained the Google Newsfeed algorithm that I must be desperate to hear about every single piece of Pixel news.

Unfortunately, from week one until 5 minutes ago, 90% of those are about price drops.

And yes, I know I can customize my feed and notifications. But I don't want to click ""I'm not interested in stories about the Google Pixel"". Because I am! I'm interested when updates supposedly improve camera speed and ram management. I'd like to be informed if they find out that this phone gives you cancer. Or turns you into a newt.

GooglePixel,Is Gboard getting worse?,I have noticed in the past few months that Gboard has been autocorrecting words to completely different words. Essentially real words that are verified through googling it of all things aren't registered in Gboard as real words. Or in some cases it knows the word you typed is correct however it will still change it to something different even if it is  spelled correctly and within the right context of the sentence. This issue and the fact that swipe text seems to have gotten significantly worse as well. Has anyone else been experiencing this? Is it just me? Is it some early implementation of AI applications to autocorrect that's just not very good yet?

GooglePixel,Pixel 2 xl still a beast,Just wanted to say that I am still using my pixel 2 xl. And it's still a beast. I have zero issues and don't plan on updating any time soon.

I thought it would be nice to have a post talking about how good the pixel 2 xl still is!

GooglePixel,Pixel Being a Smarter Smartphone,"I needed to call customer service at a faceless corporation, so I opened the phone app, dialed the number, and prepared to enter the gates of hell known as automated phone trees and long wait times. But just before pressing the call button, I was greeted with [this incredibly useful screen](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Fxj4vnDK4VyukPKW6).

Not only did the screen show the expected wait time, it gave me a daily summary of the expected wait times in case I wanted to call back at a less busy time. After dialing the number, the UI changed again and I was able to see a live transcription of the automated menus and could watch the options on screen so I didn't have to memorize each one before making my selection. And finally, once I made my menu selections, I was eventually placed on hold (yay), but instead of having to listen to the same pre-recorded message thanking me for my patience, I was able to use Hold For Me to stay on the line while I put the phone down and got some other work done.

Any phone can take pictures and open apps, but my Pixel took a mundane task that we all hate to do and made it almost tolerable. Score one for Team Pixel."

It was really boring to watch.

Also there was no word about the Orange color variant being limited (edit: I didn't hear that she said that, sry) and that it won't include unlimited photos storage.

And that photograph-interview made also no sense for an smartphone event..

It's only my opinion. Feel free to disagree



Edit 2: The camera professor was really good tho. The only part i've enjoyed. He was honest with that stuff they couldn't do now"
GooglePixel,"TIL: You can now adjust depth on the Pixel 2 portrait shots! Seriously, thank you Google for passing down features!! Wish Apple learns!","Title says it. Not sure when this was rolled out, but you can adjust depth in Google Photos, just like on the Pixel 3! (Edit: open a portrait shot in Google Photos, click on the edit button next to share button. Then edit button again. You'll find a Depth slider!)

I really, really love that Google rolled out this and Night Sight to the Pixel 2. This literally won me over on keeping my Pixel 2 and not switching over to an iPhone X that I got for a good price recently (will gift the X to my lucky brother). It was a real bummer that Apple didn't roll out the XS' Smart HDR to the iPhone X.

P.S. Ironically, Google also brought depth control to the iPhone X in Google Photos despite Apple keeping it exclusive to the XS. I actually respect Apple for its long term iOS support, but Google outdoes it by providing both OS and features roll out."
GooglePixel,The most underrated feature I love about my Pixel is the Squeeze Function,"It's so useful when you are snoozing your alarm in the morning. No need to pickup the phone and press snooze. I just instinctively squeeze my phone whenever the alarm goes off.

GooglePixel,Joshua Topolsky: I think the Pixel 2 XL may be the best phone I've ever owned,
GooglePixel,I made a teardown wallpaper of the Pixel 5 (and a template to create wallpapers to account for the zoom-in),"So I recently wanted a teardown wallpaper for my P5 but couldn't find one, so I deciced to make one. I used the ifixit X-Rays, the PBK disassembly, the JerryRig and an image of a qi coil.

[Here's what it looks like as my lock screen](https://i.imgur.com/VvXVexa.jpg)

I know, the qi coil is BS at that place but I just wanted it in there, so call it an artistic choice or whatever. [Here's one without the coil.](https://i.imgur.com/b46MGqR.jpg)

While trying to set it as my lock screen I ran in to two issues. One: You can't set a static image as your wallpaper/lock screen that fits the screen because it zooms in. The only way to prevent the zoom-in is with live wallpapers, so I tried KLWP but; Two: You can't set a live wallpaper as just your lock screen.

So I figured out the amount of zoom-in and made a template. You can download the Photoshop file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsd2Zwya3TZbr9VQj2EkB3MmI-JjWsbZ/view?usp=sharing). Maybe this can save someone some headaches and work in the future.

GooglePixel,Pixel 4 restrospective: how Google phones are hated at launch but suddenly cherished and loved after some time passes,"Hey, so I'm gonna start this by saying that I've never used a P4. I don't have any first-hand experience with its upsides or downsides, so yeah, there's that.

I just noticed a pattern where Google phones instead of being forgotten with time, somehow manage to age like fine wine. Seriously, look at every Pixel launch or even flagship launch and you'll see lots of people saying how the previous gen was just better, or how the current Pixel is a better deal..

P1 was called a weird iPhone rip-off, now it's a classic. P2 had the rockiest launch ever and now it's regarded as THE Google phone. P3 was laughed at for its weak design upgrades in the smaller model and a terrible notch on the XL, now it's considered a better buy than the P4. And the P4 was bashed into oblivion for ""the worst"" battery life, when now there are some articles even stating that Pixel 4 is generally a better deal than OnePlus's new offering. 

So I dunno, I guess Google did become the Apple or Android by making their phones age so gracefully despite being laughed at at launch. I just wish the first Pixel was a smashing success instead of a phone that just did well. I wonder how things would be now if that happened.

But hey, there's only one thing, and one thing only that truly matters.

Phone is phone.


Sincerely, Google

GooglePixel,"Finished with Flagships: Why I traded my P2XL for a P3a, and how it's been so far...","**Let me start by saying I've been an OG Nexus/Pixel user since the great Shamu, N6.** Before that, I was all-in on HTC devices. I've always appreciated great hardware and have done whatever I can to have the latest device.

**2017:** I pre-ordered my Just Black 64GB Pixel 2XL from Google Fi on launch day. I always wanted a Panda, but couldn't get one because Google is so great at stocking pre-orders...

Setting aside the ***4 RMAs*** *I had to do to get a decent screen and speakers that didn't rattle,* I really liked this phone. It looked sleek and futuristic, was fast and responsive, and got updates immediately. It was so much more premium than my OG Pixel, and yet it wasn't *so* huge that I couldn't hold it - even if it was the wrong color...

However, I could never reconcile the fact that it cost me **$850.** Nothing about the hardware or software (as great as that was) felt like it was worth that much. But I was able to sell my OG Pixel and make a decent enough back that I thought ""Meh, it is the best of the best...""

**2018:** The Pixel 3 launches, and for me, I couldn't justify the upgrade. Even with trade-in, the Pixel 3 was too expensive. I had also decided that while I liked my P2XL, I was growing weary of the size and determined I would go back to the #smallphonelyfe on my next device.

Then all the issues with P3 started surfacing, and I went ""Great job, u/mechgingeneer! You missed the lemon!""

(Note: I have used a P3 several times and it is noticeably nicer than my old P2XL - but the battery life and RAM issues were non-negotiable for me.)

**Early 2019:** The Pixel 3a launches. **Wait, it's only** ***how much?*** Like most, I was hyped - but concerned about performance. By this time, my P2XL had a few glitches, and battery life was starting to degrade - but overall, I was still happy. I read every thread out there comparing the P2 to the P3a, and the consensus was ""It's a side-grade at best - so wait for the Pixel 4."" And I did.

**Oct 15, 2019:** P4 launches, confirming my fears about the smaller P4. I waited for reviews, but ultimately, I knew I still couldn't justify the cost. I'd grown disillusioned with the fact that my $850 phone from two years ago was only worth **$143** to Google now. How could I justify that price increase?

By this time, my P2XL was showing its age. Some hiccups and bugs were pretty constant, and performance was better on Android 10, but still not at ""flagship"" level. And my hand was so *tired* of holding this thicc boi.

So I looked at my 2XL, scratches and all, and decided *""Flagships aren't worth it to me anymore.""*

I ordered a P3a, and told myself ""Use it for a week, and if you don't notice a difference, then you're ahead of where you were with the P2XL."" And *this time,* I got the color I wanted!

So my P3a arrives, and I'm immediately struck by the size and heft of the P3a - it feels too solid to be budget, but I know it is. I migrate my data over to the new phone, and put my 2XL in a drawer to await its possible resale on Swappa.

So after testing for two weeks now, I can safely say the ***Pixel 3a is the first phone in a LONG time that I have truly loved.*** There are no performance slowdowns, no battery anxiety, The camera is incredible (and yes, there *is* a noticeable difference between this and the P2XL). And it's the right size. And it cost me just over $300.

*Why would you ever use a flagship again?* I thought to myself. I might, one day when I have no student loans and money to burn. Or when Google can stop with the compromises of worse battery life in the smaller handset. Or when some new feature blows my mind. But if it's priced as high as the market is moving, then I'm done. I can't justify a $1000 rectangle in my pocket anymore.

Will I upgrade in the future? **Absolutely.** But I've changed my perspective from ""is the budget phone good enough"" to ""is the upgrade *worth* $500-600?"" So far, the answer is no - and I suspect it will be for quite some time.

*If you're a 2XL owner and have been considering the 3a or 3a XL*, I'm happy to answer questions or elaborate more. But for most, **I'd say the 3a truly is the resurrection of the Nexus 5** (And I owned and loved a Mint Nexus 5X). Can praise get any higher than that?

**TL;DR - I moved from the Pixel 2XL to the Pixel 3a, and have nothing but glowing recommendations for this phone. Regardless of what you read, I believe it IS an upgrade over the 2XL. I plan on sticking with the ""a"" series phones as long as they're around, and my wallet thanks me.**

GooglePixel,"Google mentions, then quickly removes 'Pixel 6' and 'Pixel 6 XL' from official form",
GooglePixel,New Feature Drop just started rolling out!,
GooglePixel,"Went to Best Buy, tried to find out the differences","I already preordered a regular Pixel 6, but I went into Best Buy and spent maybe 30 minutes with the two phones to see if I should cancel and get the Pro.

The things that I noted:

* Pro does feel better in hand, back to back it looks a hair thinner
* Camera visor looks to protrude just a tiny bit more on the regular pixel 6, also looks cheaper from the matte finish. If you care about how the visor looks on the phone naked, it does look just a little nicer on the pro.
* Both phones feel thinner than the iPhone 13 or S21 Ultra if you exclude the visor. This is mostly because of how much rounder the Pixels are compared to the flat sides of the iPhone. The iPhone 13's notch definitely isn't aging well. The regular Pixel 6 feels about the same as a S21 Ultra from the back in roundness and thickness. [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/TZqSXnh)
* Pro screen is noticeably brighter, you probably wouldn't miss it unless you currently have a Samsung at full brightness.
* Front cameras produce pictures that look like they're from different modules (hue/angles). After computational, the result is closer. The wider angle on the Pro would maybe get 1-2 more people in a group pic, in portrait mode it basically extended from my sternum to my belly button at arm's length.
* Most videos will appear bigger on the Pro screen once they fit to the width
* Text on the regular Pixel gets smaller, but not to the point where it's not clear. I use display settings on small, sometimes font on small. It's strange, sometimes the regular pixel has smaller text at the same setting, but more words will fit on the same line. I thought this would be a bigger discrepancy but font is clear enough on both. Text is larger on the Pro at similar settings. [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/URIj09C) (sorry for blurry, Pro is the left phone)
* The sound notifications setting sounds like a great idea (alert you to crying babies or smoke detectors). Not sure if I'd use it. [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/TrgjSpb)
* There's a sound amplifier setting to aid with boosting certain frequencies
* No squeeze to activate Assistant, but they make it so you can activate by long pressing the power button
* Video and pictures looked good on both, in Best Buy all photos kind of look the same. Computational photography makes them closer still.
* Pro can do up to 20x, the regular Pixel 6 up to 7x zoom. I held the phones in hand, there wasn't too much blur for either. You could focus on far away text at least, would be better with tripod.
* Pixel 6 has glossy buttons, Pro has matte buttons (both were stormy black)
* Fast scrolling through web pages, you could just tell that the Pro has a bit faster refresh. Really not a big difference.
* The rounded edges on the Pro didn't look any different to me compared to the S21 Ultra. Changing light reflection but no dark spots on the model I saw.
* Haptics were very similar, I played ringtones on silent and felt there wasn't really a difference except for the location. It's just more immediate in the Pro since it's located where you hold the phone, it's higher on the regular Pixel 6. Typing on both keyboards felt identical to me. The location does make a difference though, in how the haptics are perceived. I would say the haptics are just below top tier on other phones - they feel good but there's only 4 strength settings - there's a little less variability/range if that makes sense.

Overall, I think if you are in a mmWave service area and it's a $200 difference, you can definitely make a case for getting the Pro since it does feel nicer when you hold them side by side. It is very much like a Samsung phone, the curved edges make it look and feel thinner (the part you hold on the sides is thinner). The regular Pixel 6 has more plain, cheaper feeling finish (matte), but the back feels great. The way the visor looks on it is worse if you really really care about that, but if you're getting a case these things aren't going to be a big deal.

At a $300 difference, it's a bit harder to justify. While there were a lot of things the Pro did slightly better, and it does feel like a nicer phone, the Pixel 6 is such an easy recommend - and it lives up to that when you start factoring in certain personal preferences. The aesthetic reminds me a lot of my Pixel 4XL, I think if they didn't add the color it would be way more meh of a phone.

Both phones come with a surprisingly blank canvas, very few apps to the point if you're coming from a Samsung you'd be wondering if you're actually missing something. Android 12 is so simplistic in its execution, everything is less busy. But when you dig a little bit, you find out there's a setting for what you wanted, or one you didn't know you did.

GooglePixel,Please add squeeze back to the next Pixel,"I had my Pixel 2 for almost 3 years and I recently switched to the Pixel 4A 5G, because I was experiencing really fast battery drain on my Pixel 2.

It is just such a useful and underrated feature in my opinion, and I really hope they bring it back for future generation Pixels."
GooglePixel,My brother passed away and my mom put me in charge of his phone. Help.,"I have experience with Google pixels. I had a 3a until its death. His phone is a pixel 2. He had a formal will made (he had terminal cancer) and my mom is the executor so I'm sure if I fuck this up we could get access somehow but I'd like to do this all right.

I need to

~~A) back up his Google accounts to my phone number. His service will end soon with his phone provider so this is a top priority.~~

~~B) make sure I have all his photos and videos to his children safely secured (I think I've managed to do this) plus all his other photos and videos he's taken over the years. Thankfully he did a good job scrubbing his phone and there's nothing NSFW.~~

C) save all his text messages and Facebook messages between him and his exes. One has absolutely no guardianship over their daughter and my brother passed it along to my parents. Her texts are a goldmine of her maliciousness and how little she cares for their daughter, but occasionally she tries to weasel her way back in before disappearing again. His other ex is a good mom overall but was physically and mentally abusive towards my brother. I need these texts saved as well, in case she ever tries to keep our nephew away from us. I don't have the energy or mental stamina to go through them and save screenshots right now.

I know I could manage to do all these things safely and securely if I researched well, but I am also in the midst of planning his viewing and all the other things that come with a twenty nine years old man's passing, helping care for his two children, helping my parents while they manage this unbelievable grief, and being a mother to my two children and a full time student in a bachelor's program approaching finals.

I am finding a lot of somewhat helpful articles but I really want to do this absolutely properly.

Thank you for any and all help. And if anyone has any suggestions of things I back up that I didn't think of, please don't hesitate to share.

One last thing... fuck cancer

Edit: wow. I am completely overwhelmed by the response this got. I have been on reddit a long time, and you never know which way these kinds of posts can go. Clearly the pixel community is an extraordinarily kind community. I only need to figure out the Facebook messages and I will be complete. Thank you SO much for all your help, and for the condolences. My brother was an exceptional person and it breaks my heart his kids won't know their dad like we did - but this will help. Thank you thank you thank you!"

GooglePixel,"Tip: If you don't charge your Pixel overnight and have always-on display enabled, keep it face-down on a table. It'll turn off AOD and save a LOT of power","On the 2020 Pixels, at least. (I own a 4a 5G.) This is easier if you have a case that provides a bit of clearance over the screen.

I tried both AOD on and off on two consecutive nights. Keeping the screen visible (and thus AOD on) resulted in about 14% drain from bedtime to morning. Flipping the phone on its face (and thus AOD off) resulted in 0% drain over roughly the same amount of time. Yes, _zero_ drain. Started at full at bedtime, was still full when I woke up in the morning.

This also has the side benefit of preventing unnecessary burn-in from AOD.

I'm curious just how long I can squeeze out of my 4a 5G now... Even with all that drain overnight, I was still getting two days of use out of it. Wonder if I could stretch to three!"
GooglePixel,So far the Pixel 5 is as close to *my* perfect phone as I've had in a long time,"Not since the original Pixel have I been this fully satisfied with a phone. It's definitely not perfect, but it does a REALLY good job of covering so many of my core concerns. I was coming from a Pixel 3 XL, having owned the 2 XL, and 1 non-XL before that, (not to mention Nexi 5x, 6, 5, and 4 prior). My 3 XL, which I know is not universal, had become a deeply laggy mess. In particular it would frequently seize up for 1-3 seconds while doing an input (keyboard, swipe, tapping a button, or pressing volume) and then register it as though I had held down that control that whole time. It otherwise performed relatively well, but was still inconsistent. And battery life was pretty awful overall, with me often at 30% around 1PM (and this was after replacing a bloated battery). And memory management was horrific, with multitasking limited enough that depending on what I was doing, I wouldn't switch out of some apps because I knew I'd lose my place. Additionally 11 made everything worse, made Android Auto perform a lot more slowly, and made it so if I was doing anything too intensive (AA Maps + Podcast, or playing a game) the phone would constantly re-send the latest notification to my Wear OS watch, draining its battery. I was done.

The 5 fixes every single one of these issues. It's absurdly fast. I know there were concerns about the processor, and I know most people have dispelled them, but truly, for me, coming from the 3 XL the performance difference is night and day. No lags, fast task switching, fast and reliable interactions, just overall really beautiful. Photo processing is  the only downside here, and I do see it. It's recognizably slower and I do worry about how that'll be long-term. That's the only performance hit.

RAM management is an instant game changer (literally), as I can swap out of a game, check email, open a link, do some research, and go back to the game and pick up where I left off. It's exactly what I wanted.

Android Auto is SO much quicker and more responsive, consistently. And my watch battery is right now at 81% when driving with it would have driven it to the low 60s or mid-50s. Oh, and bonus: I have a magnetic mount in my car. On my 3 XL I originally used a case with a plate, but after I realized the plate completely screwed up the compass, I found that with a thin clear slightly grippy case, there was enough for the magnet to latch onto in the phone that it could sort of hold the 3 XL on its own. The 5, meanwhile, latches on HARD without a case and holds really solidly. Easy to remove, but doesn't fly off if I hit a heavy bump like the 3 XL. Bonus.

Also, totally subjective, but I really like the size. I mainly bought XLs for the battery, and this made that unnecessary. It's way more one-handable and light. Also the surface isn't slippery, and I'm not as terrified of dropping it, so I'm running without a case for now. And the green is very nice. My first non-black phone since the Nexus 6.

But the biggest thing of all that changes the entire game is the battery. The absolute lowest I've seen the phone since getting it (accounting for time charging while driving, or leaving it on a wireless charger which isn't optimized for this phone so is only putting out 5W max) is 69% outside of the first evening of over-use. And that's with the same normal use (probably more because it's new and exciting) I put my 3 XL through, including games, text messaging, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, research, OneNote, Excel, etc., etc., etc. This is my work and life phone and I use it a LOT. Today's the first day in YEARS I didn't carry an external battery in my pocket for safety. I seriously don't feel like I need it. It's taking work to get used to, but battery anxiety may be over with this phone. And honestly, this plus the RAM were the two biggest things I wanted from this phone and I got them.

It's not without issues. As mentioned, photo processing is slower. The haptics are a step down in quality from previous Pixels. The front speaker might as well just be the bottom-firing one because the left one's pretty junk (hoping for tuning in updates). Phone calls are \*fine\*, but definitely not as good, but I rely 80% on Bluetooth so that's not huge for me. Also the bottom speaker placement is annoying FOR ME, because I mostly hold my phone in my left hand, which means it rests on my pinky, and my pinky sits precisely on the speaker and blocks it. Hopefully I can adjust my hold to fix that.

So yeah, it has a few small issues that would probably bother me more if it weren't for the life-changing stuff above that really makes me so insanely happier with this phone. This phone is as perfect for ME as I can reasonably want.

I know there are a ton of these threads, but I still wanted to share my joy, and I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might have.

EDIT: Also, I live in LA, and use T-Mobile, so I happen to have 5G nearly everywhere I go which I honestly didn't expect. Some places where I had terrible LTE aren't any better. Everywhere else I've ranged as high as 160Mbps down and 98Mbps up, but usually have at least 30/40. Do I need that? Nah. But it's cool."

[This guy](https://youtu.be/BZI3qUhkawI?t=476) gave a better evaluation of the phone's performance in the first 5 minutes than most channels do in their entire video.

GooglePixel,Google's lack of global warranty on Pixels is behind the competition and a shame,"[Apple](https://store.apple.com/Catalog/Images/worldwidewarranty.html) has a global warranty where you can receive service from any of their local branches. [Samsung](https://samsungcarecentre.com/samsung-mobile-warranty-check-claim/) isn't as clear as Apple, but I also see things online that they try to offer an international warranty.

This wasn't something I had previously payed a lot of attention to, but while overseas, my Pixel's battery swelled up. I purchased my Pixel directly through Google, I am a subscriber to Google Fi (which touts international travel as a key advantage over the competition), and the battery swelled in a country where Google sells Pixels. Despite the Google stars basically aligning to the maximum extent possible, at the end of the day, since there is no global warranty, you're simply out of luck if something like this happens while outside your home country.

Customer service told me I would need to either wait until I flew back to the States or mail it back to a friend and have them process the replacement for me. I followed up again and asked how I could fly or mail a Pixel with a bulging battery safely and legally and they just ignored it and reiterated I should either fly or ship the phone. I even reached out to the special Reddit Requests helpline here that escalates problems when regular support isn't working. They took one look and said they were withdrawing the previous offer to replace my phone and I should find a responsible way to dispose of it locally. Honestly, with the apparent complete lack of internal infrastructure at Google to handle international problems like this, I can't fault them. The problem is in the warranty policy, and the policy sucks.

Google is one of the biggest multi-national companies on the planet. My case is just an example, but it's an example of how Google often seems to act as if the USA is the entirety of the world. If the competition can find a way to make global warranties work, there's really no excuse for Google if they want to make a serious play in the phone hardware game and not just have another side project hobby."
GooglePixel,I believe Google is moving in the right direction with the Pixel line.,"This year, I feel like Google's vision for the Pixel line is significantly clearer and much less ambiguous.

Looking at this in the perspective of the Pixel 5, going for a more simplistic, straightforward, 'appeal to everyone' kind of approach, I think, is what Pixel needs to be, or in fact, was **meant** to be.

They have made a simple, clean, super effective, do it all phone that can impress and appeal to almost anyone.

They have given everything a person would need out of a phone, nothing more, nothing less. All in a comfortably compact 6 inch package for hundreds less than most flagships. No wonder it won Readers' Choice Smartphone of the Year. This is a Pixel like never before. **THIS** is what people have waited for Pixel to be for years. 

I believe Pixel phones are beginning to move in the right direction this year. No abysmal battery life, no bathtub notch, no failed experiments, just

**Simple.
Clean.
Minimalistic.
Effectivity.**

I feel like Pixel phones should be like the **iPhones of Android,** but better. 

Clean and simple, highly optimised, customisable, smooth software with long support, good hardware and durability, with things that people actually want and need in a phone, and some bells and whistles added in, brewed into a formula slowly developed and refined year after year into what could become some of the greatest phones on the market, all for a more **competitive price.** 

Please, Google, **keep moving in this direction.** This has great potential. 

I'm not saying Google has got there yet. What I'm saying is that they're starting to get there.

Do correct me if this is commonplace, and if I am making a hue and cry for no reason.

My friends and I did some astrophotography with my Pixel 4 XL, near San Francisco in 2021. The result was  [https://www.instagram.com/p/CC1rU-Gngm3/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CC1rU-Gngm3/).

The googlepixel\_us account copied that photo in 2023 and posted it in [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqv9R9WP-dH/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqv9R9WP-dH/). The photo has close to 80k likes so far, which is probably the highest in their account. They did not provide any credits and chose to completely ghost us when we asked (in the post as well as in DM).

I am unsure what the exact source of their copy is - could be any of

1. Instagram (possibly not, as the crop in their post is wider)
2. My comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/debalin90/status/1285370963400380416?s=20)
3. Google Photos itself (I had it saved there in Storage Saver quality)
4. Some other surface that I either don't remember (took the photo \~3 years ago) or not aware of (in any case, they certainly did not credit or reach out to me or ask for permission before posting on IG)

Looking at other posts by the same account, seems like giving credit is common. I am not an Instagram celebrity or anything, but the ghosting didn't feel right after using my photo. Hence the question. Thanks!

P.S. I absolutely love my Pixel devices and am well versed and bought into the ecosystem. I own a Pixel 7 Pro (and multiple other devices) and have a few night sky photos from there posted on my Insta as well. In other words, I admire their devices and will most probably continue to invest in them. This post is has nothing to do against the quality of their devices.

GooglePixel,Collecting feedback related to settings and device configuration,"Hey Redditors, 

We're trying to collect feedback about configuring your Pixel phone - what are the pain points you have with managing, toggling, or discovering settings? 

In particular, do you ever run into any of the following types of issues with your Pixel:
 
1. **There's a setting you constantly have to manage yourself** (e.g. you turn Bluetooth on and off 10 times a day)
2. **There's a setting you love, but wish you had found out about earlier** (e.g. you are a big DND user, but never realized there was a DND scheduling feature)
3. **There's a setting or configuration you wish your phone could be smarter about** (e.g. why can't my Pixel put itself in airplane mode when I'm taking off in a plane?)
4. **There's a setting or configuration you wish your phone could remind you about** (e.g. I wish my phone could make sure I don't forget to silence my phone at work)
5. **There are settings you changed the second you setup your phone** (e.g. I turned off haptic feedback right away after setting up my Pixel)

We don't have any features or product plans to announce right now, but we hope to incorporate this feedback to improve your Settings experience on Pixel devices in the future. 

For any pain points or feedback you have, it would also be great if you could explain as much as you can about your context and why it is a pain point. For instance, if there's a setting you toggle 20 times a day, explain the scenarios where you need to manage the setting. This will help us better understand how to address the problem. 

Thanks, and we look forward to hearing your feedback!

GooglePixel,I've used every Pixel phone. Here are my thoughts on the Pixel 5 after a few months of use.,"Hey guys,

So I've had the privilege to own every Pixel flagship device and I've loved every iteration despite the quirks. When the Pixel 5 was announced, I was a bit mixed on Google's decision to use midrange specs.

On paper, if you compare specs, the Pixel 5 seems worse than the Pixel 4XL. It's got a lower resolution screen, an inferior processor and GPU, no neural core chip for faster image processing, and a body covered in a material that feels more like plastic than metal.

Despite my assumptions, I decided to give it a fair chance. So, after using the phone for a few months, here are my thoughts on the Pixel 5.

Performance

The Pixel 5 has, what many may call, a midrange processor and GPU. Based on benchmarks, it's closer to the Pixel 3 when it comes to raw performance.

However, when it comes to real-world usage, it's pretty much impossible to tell that the phone is running on a mid-range processor. The phone runs very smoothly and handles pretty every task without any stutters. I must say that I don't game on my phone, so the experience might be a bit different for people who game a lot. The 8 gigs of RAM made sure apps didn't have to reload often and the fast refresh rate of the screen made for a very pleasant experience.

If I were to nitpick, I'd say the only time I noticed the phone didn't have flagship specs was when I took a bunch of photos and had to wait for the photos to process. To be honest, it's not something most people would notice.

I do have concerns about the long-term performance of the phone though. Right now, it's running flawlessly, but as apps get more demanding over time, the phone has the potential to be worse than the phones with high-end processors.

Design

As someone who prefers smaller phones, I love the Pixel 5. It's very light and super comfortable to hold. The size is great for one-handed use. Size-wise, it's close to the iPhone 11 Pro, but thinner and much lighter.

In terms of materials, the phone's back is made from recycled aluminum with cutouts for wireless charging. In terms of durability, it's fantastic as I don't have to worry about cracking the back. But it comes to in-hand feel, it doesn't feel like metal because of the bio-resin coating Google has on it. So, if you associate quality with the cold feeling of metal and glass, you might think it doesn't feel as premium and that's a fair critique. I wish Google went for brushed aluminum like the first Pixel or HTC M7/M8.

I don't mind it at this price because the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. Also, I like how grippy the phone is due to the bio-resin texture. It won't slip out of your hands easily.

Screen

The screen is absolutely beautiful. The resolution has downgraded to 1080p though, but due to the smaller size, I can't tell the difference. It looks plenty sharp and there's no pixelation.

Also, this is one of the only phones with perfectly symmetrical bezels. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but I appreciate that attention to detail.

The 90hz refresh rate is great. It makes everything look fluid and I think that feature alone is worth it over the Pixel 4a XL. As I mentioned in my [Note 20 review](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote20/comments/iw4a5q/honest_thoughts_on_the_note_20_ultra_after_3_weeks/), the difference between 60hz and 90hz is significant, but not that much between 90hz and 120hz. So, most users would be pretty happy with the 90hz refresh rate.

It's not all perfect though. Auto brightness on this phone isn't great. Sometimes it lowers the brightness for no reason, which forces me to manually adjust the brightness.

Battery

One of the biggest reasons to get the Pixel 5 is the battery life. This is easily the longest-lasting Pixel flagship in my experience. I can easily go a full day with this and not worry about charging. The Pixel 4XL in comparison barely made it to the end of the day.

In terms of screen on time, I'm consistently getting around 6 hours on a full day of use with a bunch of standby time baked in. I'm currently daily driving the S21 Ultra and I'd say the battery life of the Pixel 5 is very close to the S21 Ultra, which is amazing.

Camera

The camera is the one thing I'm slightly disappointed by this year. Don't get me wrong. It's still one of the best cameras out there, but it's pretty much the same camera as the Pixel 4 line. Google has been using the same sensor since the Pixel 3 and improvements have only been incremental since then.

The Pixel phones have been popular because of the camera quality and I think Google is starting to lose that advantage. In terms of quality, I'd rank it at #3.

I do appreciate that Google added a wide-angle camera this time. But it's not as wide as what you get on a Galaxy or iPhone. I'd love to see an even wider wide-angle and a dedicated zoom camera in the next Pixel.

The new software features are also helpful this time. For example, I like that I no longer need to get into Night Sight each time when needed. It automatically switches to it similar to Apple. For those who don't like it, Google has now added the option to turn it off. Also, Google has added the ability to take portrait shots with Night Sight, which is pretty sweet.

And while the front camera placement is aesthetically pleasing, it's not the best place to put it for usability reasons. You have to retrain yourself to hold the phone to your side instead of the centre if you want to take a symmetrical selfie.

Sensors

There's no face unlock this time. I think the Pixel 4XL face unlock was just as good as iPhones. But, in a pandemic hit world, fingerprint is better than face unlock in my opinion. The placement is great and the circular design provides a big enough surface area. It works flawlessly and it's incredibly fast. In my experience, it works way better than the S21 Ultra.

Google removed a couple of sensors this time. First, there's no Soli, which I don't mind. I don't think it was implemented well on the Pixel 4XL. The technology is quite interesting, so I hope Google brings it back at some point when it's better.

And no squeeze functionality for the Assistant. Although I rarely used it, it was good to have for fast access to the assistant. The gesture replacement isn't that good.

Speakers

When the phone came out, most reviewers bashed the speakers. So I was expecting the speakers to be horrible. To be honest, they're not as bad as the reviews made me believe. I've had no issues taking calls or watching content. Yes, when comparing side by side with iPhone or Galaxy phones, you can tell the sound isn't as rich, but it's not nearly as bad. Also, the update in December improved the quality with adaptive sound.

Haptics

My last point is on the haptics. The vibration motor isn't as good as the 4XL or the iPhones. The iPhones are the gold standard and no Android phone comes close. I think the Pixel 4XL had one of the better vibration motors, so it was a bit sad to see the motor wasn't that good on the Pixel 5. It might not be big deal to you, but I think a good vibration motor makes a big difference. I hope Google improves it in the next generation.

Worth it?

Overall, I think the Pixel 5 is the most well-rounded phone Google has made. The price, while slightly higher than I'd like is not too bad and the user experience is flagship level despite the mid-range specs.

If you have a Pixel 4, I don't recommend getting it unless you want a better battery. But if you have an older Pixel, I think it's a pretty good buy."

GooglePixel,"PSA: Pixel/Nexus updates can still be subject to carrier approval | AKA - Where is my update, and why?","If you purchased a Nexus or Pixel phone, regardless of where, the updates do come direct from Google. There is no disputing that. However, carriers are still involved in the process, and this is what leads to the largest amount of confusion surrounding the process. I'm going to attempt to clarify the Nexus/Pixel update process, and I will be sourcing everything that I can, to include citing Google employees directly.

First, let's cover the basics. If you have a phone that receives updates direct from Google's servers, you are subject to Google's OTA rollout process. This only impacts phones that get their updates direct from Google, so your Samsung Galaxy Whatever is not impacted (except for the S4 GPE, which I believe is done with updates anyway).

## How the Google OTA Rollout Process Works

Per Google engineer Dan Morrill; [DIRECT SOURCE] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1r1dz4/44_kitkat_has_started_rolling_out_on_the_n4/cdiwt6f/) | [EXTERNAL SOURCE] (https://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-engineer-Dan-Morrill-talks-about-Android-OTA-updates-and-why-you-need-to-be-patient_id49573)

> Rollouts are conducted in phases. Typically they start at 1% of devices for around 24 - 48 hours; we watch the return rates and resulting device checkins and error reports (if any), and make sure nothing looks wrong before sending it to more. Then typically it goes to 25%, 50%, 100% over the course of a week or two.

> What the percentages mean is that when your device checks in, it has a 1% chance (for example) of being offered the OTA. If it doesn't (randomly) get an offer, it will never get an offer until the next batch.

> IOW, once your device checks in and gets turned down, that's it until the next batch. Mashing on the ""check for updates"" button just causes your device to check in again, and get automatically turned down again. Think about how that makes your device feel! WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE PHONES?!

> That said, once the new batch does start, hitting that button does give you a new roll of the dice -- but once. Since devices usually only check in for system updates every 24 hours (I think? Certainly on a many-hours basis) this can get you your shot sooner than it would happen on its own.

> So, mash away. :) Just be patient, and mashing on it more often than once or twice a day isn't going to gain you anything.

> Edit: also, keep in mind that this isn't first-come/first-served. You're not racing other devices to get your slot in the current batch, or something.

## A Change to the 'Check Update' Button

Ok, so it takes a few weeks, and hitting the update button does nothing. Well, that was from 3-4 years ago, and things change. We saw an update in 2017 that altered this, and learned of it courtesy of Google employee Elliott Hughes; [DIRECT SOURCE] (https://plus.google.com/+ElliottHughes/posts/2VmmB3jfeTp)

> One thing I haven't seen the tech press notice is that the button in Settings to check for an update actually works now. If you're running the latest Google Play Services, you shouldn't need to sideload an OTA or flash a system image just because you're impatient...

> How does this interact with the Google's staged rollout of new OS releases, you ask? When a device checks in because you've specifically asked it to, we flag that this is user-initiated and so you're not subject to the usual limitations. So even if we're at 1% rollout and 1% of users already have the update, if you manually check you'll still be offered it, even though a background check at the same time wouldn't.

## Carrier Involvement

However, he since edited it based on questions from myself and others, and added this gem:

> How does this interact with your carrier's additional restrictions? (This was a question that came up a lot in the comments.) If your carrier hasn't approved the update, their restrictions will still apply if you're on their network.

And herein lies the problem that causes so much contention; the carrier's role in this process. Google has agreements with various carriers that allow for certain perks for both sides. One of these perks for the carrier is the ability to review the update for compatibility for that carrier's specific features. And yes, Apple deals with this too. Apple, however, releases their update when EVERY carrier is done (and due to Apple's market position, they get priority in the review process, further speeding this up). Google, on the other hand, pushes the update when it's ready, regardless of carrier status. If your carrier isn't involved, you're eligible for the update. If your carrier has approved the update, then you're eligible for the update. And if your carrier has not yet approved the update, then you are not yet eligible for the update. When the carrier approves it, Google will push it to you.

And it's not just carrier approval. In some case, Google actually does full builds for certain carriers. For example, if you check [Google's OTA links page for the OG Pixel] (https://developers.google.com/android/ota#sailfish), you'll see custom builds for Verizon, Rogers, Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile, Project Fi, and even just ""Europe."" When your sim is detected and your carrier has a custom build, THAT is the update that you will receive.

As bad as this sounds, the Nexus 6 was Google's worst offender. Regardless of where you bought your phone from, installing a sim from AT&T would not just associate your phone to the carrier, but [it would also download AT&T bloatware (which could be removed, thankfully)] (https://gizmodo.com/at-t-will-muddy-up-your-nexus-6-with-bloatware-1657796686). Other carriers also had this perk with the Nexus 6 and, thankfully, this perk went away with the 5X, 6P, and Pixel lineup. And just to reiterate, [it didn't matter where you bought your Nexus 6 from.] (https://phandroid.com/2015/03/12/nexus-6-verizon-backup-bloatware/)

## Carrier Association, and How it Works

When you first boot up your phone with a carrier's sim installed, that phone becomes associated to that carrier in Google's database. This is NOT a carrier lock, and it is used by Google for identification purposes. Allow me to demonstrate

* [Click Here] (https://play.google.com/store?hl=en&tab=w8) (EDIT: Do this on your PC, not your phone)
* Click the gear icon in the top right and select ""Settings""
* Under my devices, you'll see the carrier association(s) of all your Android devices that currently have your Google account linked.

In my case, I have T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T for certain phones. My Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield ATV, and LG Watch Style are listed as ""No carrier.""

Google maintains this list and, when they push out an update, all phones associated to a carrier that has approved the update, or a carrier that has no role in the process, receive that update. Carriers that have yet to approve the update are not pushed the update.

You can change your carrier association by swapping to a different carrier's sim and rebooting. Or, you can delete your carrier association by powering down, removing the sim (do not reinsert), powering up, and performing a full factory reset. With no sim installed, the fresh phone has no carrier association and will pull the latest available update.

## Live Demonstration

[Here's the video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgO29_yN9M&feature=youtu.be), and for those who can't watch right now, below is a summary of what happened. Please note that I will be demonetizing the video (no ads from me) for 48 hours or for however long this is on the front page of the posted sub(s), whichever lasts longer. I do normally like to monetize my (admittedly low quality) content, but my goal with this video and associated post was to spread knowledge, not make a quick buck.

* Demonstrated that it is a Pixel 2, on the T-Mobile network, with the 8.0 September software installed.
* Manually checking for update shows that system is up to date.
* I swapped sim to AT&T, who does not review Pixel 2 updates to the same degree (if at all) that T-Mobile does.
* Upon power on and connecting to the AT&T network, the update is available and begins to install. I power down.
* Reinstalling the T-Mobile sim and powering up actively blocks the install of the update, and once again states that 'system is up to date' with the September software.

## Why I Didn't Complete the Install

This isn't just the November security update for the Pixel 2. It's also the October security update, has some bug fixes, and even some minor UI changes. Google has already done a custom one for Deutsche Telekom (DTAG) and Verizon. I suspect that one is coming for T-Mobile (and possibly Project Fi carriers). If this is the case, then the existing ""normal"" update could impact or even break any of the following features; Wifi Calling, VoLTE, ViLTE, RCS. T-Mobile has proprietary implementations of each (God forbid we use the active standards...), so Google has to develop for this, and T-Mobile likes to test it.

## How Nexus/Pixel Updates Work on T-Mobile US (and likely other partner carriers)

For this, I don't have a direct source, but I will provide a source at the end that confirms that this is exactly how it works on Verizon. For T-Mobile, I'm basing this on several years of experience with Nexus/Pixels devices on the carrier, and the fact that my experience matches the confirmed Verizon process.

* Android OS updates - Anything that changes the version number is subject to T-Mobile review and may be delayed (the 7.1 update on my Nexus 5X was 1-2 months behind global rollout)
* Security Updates - Anything that ONLY modifies the phone based on the latest security bulletin does not get reviewed by T-Mobile, and hits phones the same day as the global rollout
* Software patches - Anything that modifies the functionality of the phone more than just a security update, but doesn't alter the Android version number, is still subject to T-Mobile review (the current Pixel 2 update being a perfect example).

[And here's the link detailing the same process for Verizon.] (https://9to5google.com/2016/10/06/google-confirms-that-verizon-will-handle-system-updates-for-pixels-it-sells-but-google-will-still-manage-security-updates/)

> Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store.

I'm still digging and may update this later, but I recall Google/Verizon later clarifying the system updates, and that ""managing"" meant still coming direct from Google, AFTER Verizon approval. Also, even the unlocked models ended up getting the 'Verizon' branded firmware (likely for feature compatibility).

## Conclusion

You Nexus/Pixel phone may be subject to carrier restrictions which delay software updates. You can circumvent this by using ADB with the [factory images] (https://developers.google.com/android/images) or [OTA images posted] (https://developers.google.com/android/ota) on Google's website. Alternatively, if you don't want to use ADB, you can circumvent the carrier association by swapping sims, or removing and performing a factory reset.

But for MOST users, I recommend waiting the additional days or weeks for the update just in case there was a carrier-specific firmware, or carrier-specific bug fix that was needed.

GooglePixel,In a house full of iPhones,"Went to my brothers house for his pups first birthday party today (yes, that's a thing nowadays) and was snapping some portrait mode pictures of the birthday boy with my new P4XL. As I was showing everyone some of the pics I got, I immediately and unanimously was chosen as the photographer for the night. My brother and his girlfriend insisted that I take all the pictures and send them to them. ""Oh my god, that phone's camera is so crystal clear and the portrait mode is 100x better than mine"". Compliments flying all over the place.

Most of family and friends there had iPhones (8's and up) and were commenting how vivid my pics were compared to theirs.

Now, I am not here to brag on my behalf of how good of a photographer I am, because I am definitely not. I just wanted to remind the cynics on this sub that even though the P4 doesn't have the wide angle, it makes up for it tenfold through the camera software & hardware Google has perfected over the few years with the Pixel line. Heck, name another *Android* phone that can take better pictures.

* the battery life still lasts all day

* Active edge is an incredible feature that I use constantly and blows my mind every time

* wowee the camera

* Fingerprint scanner swiping

* still snappy and responsive

Anyone else think this was the best phone ever built?

EDIT: I am looking forward to the 4a as my replacement. Although there have been some glowing reviews for the 4xl in this thread, I don't think that it is enough, given the price point and battery life.

GooglePixel,Pixel 5 review after 2 weeks of use,"Hey everyone, I’ve been using the Pixel 5 for about 2 weeks now. Let me give you my thoughts on the device. 

I came from a Pixel 2XL that I owned for 2 years. I changed for the Pixel 5 because of: 

* the great deal in Europe, charging “only” 613€ and giving you the Bose headphones 
* the expectation of a much better battery 
* the expectation of a much better screen 
* looking forward to a smaller screen for easier and more practical one-handed use 
* the upcoming lack of security updates on the Pixel 2XL 
* my P2XL getting worse regarding battery and small “breakdowns” like getting pretty hot and stuttering 

So let’s see how my expectations turned out in reality. 

I can say that I am very happy with the Pixel 5. Actually, all my expectations have been met. The biggest and most important improvement for me is the **battery**. I used to need to charge my P2XL once midday to have it last till the evening. With the P5, I have not managed to get it below about 25 percent in the evening, regardless of heavy use. I am a journalist, so I have to do a lot of research, note-taking and talking on the phone during the day, plus taking photos and short videos. The P5 gives me the relieving feeling that I can count on it to not die on me during the day – not matter how extensive the use will be. On days with less usage I arrived at home with 65 percent. That is so f’in great! 

Next up let me talk about the **screen**. This phone is fun and enjoyable to use and look at. Surfing, texting, watching YouTube is just that tiny bit nicer when you have a crisp, bright screen with even bezels. The higher refresh rate definitely shows when scrolling fast. The only thing that could have been better is the maximum brightness. In the brightest sunlight, the P5 screen is still readable, but it would have to be about 20 percent brighter to make it perfect. 

The P5 is a no-BS phone, meant to be used rather than admired. Do you understand what I mean? This phone is built to serve you during the day, and is less appealing to the **premium phone** **concept** like the iPhone does. The P5 is a nice-looking phone, but I like that it does not give me anxiety to drop it and shatter its glass back. I like that the aluminium back may look a bit boring, but it convinced be that I will use this phone without a case. There are no cutting-edge manufactured, shiny edges or backs. I do not fear to damage this phone easily, I think I will rock this phone naked for about a year and then refresh the look with a dbrand skin. This may not be for everyone – many people do like premium-looking phones to show off. I am not one of the them. The P5 does look nice, but it doesn’t stand out. To me, that is an advantage. 

Now let’s get to the **speakers**. I do not feel they are a deal-breaker at all. You can definitely watch videos and listen to podcasts on this device without being bothered by the tinnier top speaker. I do listen to a lot of talking podcasts on the phone while I cook etc., and the quality to me is not even that much worse than on the P2XL. Music might be a different issue, but I never listen to music on the phone – I use Chromecast, Fire TV, or of course headphones for that. It’s been a trade-off made by Google – the right one, in my opinion: I’d rather have even bezels and no notch than better speakers than those used in the P5. 

**To** **sum it up**, the P5 is everything I loved and love about Google phones. (My “career” has been: Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5, (OnePlus One,) Pixel 2XL, Pixel 5.) They are great to use, they offer tons of customization, they have great cameras, and they always receive updates first. For me, the step down the price range by building a less-premium phone is exactly the right direction. 

I can’t really say what I would even **improve** about this device. Maybe build in top speakers, mirroring the bottom ones, if that is possible? And maybe drop the price even a little more, towards 550 or 500€. But apart from that, I’m just really happy, especially considering the Bose deal. 

And no, I do not have **gap issues**, I’m probably one of the lucky ones… 

Feel free to ask any questions. Have a great day!"
GooglePixel,Totally blind with the Pixel 5 online and I'm lovin it,"This is the long time dream phone for me:

GooglePixel,"Phone (most likely) stolen by FedEx driver. FedEx acknowledges phone was ""lost"". Google won't file claim and won't replace phone.","This is a long story, but sharing all the details here. Welcome to my last 4 weeks of customer support hell. 

I ordered a Pixel on Dec 2, 2018 and received confirmation that the phone would be shipped on January 4, 2019.  I went out of town over the holidays and returned January 1 to an email stating that my phone had been delivered on the 28th of Dec. Only problem? No phone was at my house. 

I called Google and they identified that FedEx had said it was successfully delivered and gave me the name of the person who signed for it . I shared that this was not my name (which they knew) and that I was thousands of miles away when the phone was theoretically delivered. Additionally, the phone was delivered 6 days prior to when it was initially reported to be delivered and I was not provided with any updates information alerting me that it was going to be shipped.  Google said they would ""make sure I was taken care of"", would investigate, and would get back to me.  

After multiple attempts at getting updates, Google finally responds two weeks later stating that they are closing my case because FedEx confirmed that the phone was successfully delivered. I escalated and was told that a supervisor would look further into it. 

A few days later I am told that because my case was already closed and FedEx confirmed delivery there's nothing they can do. I call back to yet another customer support person and am told that I need to contact FedEx.  I do so. 

FedEx chats me with me and shares that they will investigate and get back to me. I wait a few days and FedEx finally reports back that it was a seasonal worker who delivered the package. They  identify that there isn't anything they can do, but note that they will mark my package as ""package unable to be found."" They tell me that Google must file a claim as the shipper. 

I call Google back with this information and am told that they will file a claim with FedEx.  I am promised information in 2 days. 3 days later, I email back to see what the status is. Google emails back and shares that because I had already escalated and found that the package was successfully delivered I must open the claim with FedEx myself. Now remember,  FedEx already told me that I couldn't do this. 

This is starting to be entirely ridiculous.  I call Google again,  explain the situation and ask if we can call FedEx together. They say they'll look into it. I get an email a few days later (again) that there's nothing they can do.

 I call back, explain the situation .again . and they finally agree to call FedEx with me. We make a plan to do so the next day when the support person can get the right individual on the line. 

Which brings us to today, a month after the phone was ""lost."" I call FedEx again on my own ahead of time and they give me a reference number for the lost package.  The customer support person from Google  then calls me 30 minutes after we had agreed to chat and says, ""oh yeah, hey, sorry. Because you already had an escalation which resulted in us finding the package was successfully delivered there nothing we can do. File a claim with FedEx."" 

Wtf do I do? I feel like I'm talking in circles and don't know what other recourse I have at this point. FedEx won't let me file a claim and Google won't reach back out to FedEx (despite me giving them the lost package reference number from FedEx as well). 

Update: through a combination of escalations and support from this thread,  Google has confirmed that they will send me a replacement.  Now just to make sure that this one makes it into my hands!"

GooglePixel,Thank You Google!,"Well, my Pixel finally crapped out today. It got smashed a few weeks ago in all the insanity that is hurricane prep, but all that happened was a smashed back and front (using a rhinoshield). However, this week, I started noticing some issues with the screen, which made me think that there was a deeper issue. Well, this morning I woke up and 99% of the screen was covered in black/purple swirls and my touches weren't being read at all. 

I hadn't wanted to fix my phone, since the new iPhone X and XL2 are both coming soon, and I'd just lost my job due to the hurricane and didn't want to blow $300 when I could just finance the new phone when it comes out like usual. Unfortunately, that didn't look like an option anymore, as I need a phone for my job hunt and can't wait the month or two it'll take to get a new one. So, I went in to my local UBreakIFix to get just the screen repaired, which is usually $150 or so. Shockingly, they told me they would replace and repair everything wrong with the phone, for free, as Google was paying all costs associated with Pixel repairs in Florida. I honestly wanted to cry, as I've been really disheartened with all of the shit going on recently, so to have something actually work out so well was a huge relief.

So, in the end I just want to thank Google for doing something to help someone right now. "

Google is notorious for their terrible customer service so buyer beware if you're having trouble with trade-ins, missing packages, RMA returns, or anything else. A quick search shows a lot of people have lost their accounts or lost the option of buying anything with their Google account after they charged back Google.

If you have a choice, don't buy directly from Google.

If you have to buy directly from Google, use a email that is not your main Google account and do not link the emails.

P.S. this seems to apply to charging back any company that you have an active account with. If you charge back Steam or EA, they'll ban your account and you'll lose access to all your games."

Be warned about this product.","I bought a Pixel 7 Pro in October and my wife bought a regular Pixel 7. We both decided to splurge on a better case this time around and went with the Bellroy leather cases. These cases are $60 each, so about $120 in total.

After only 4 months of standard, regular use, BOTH of our cases have started to tear and peel at the corners. See images here: [https://imgur.com/a/rwMNpyQ](https://imgur.com/a/rwMNpyQ)

Given this product was $60 and only lasted 4 months, I thought clearly this should be covered by Bellroy and can't be normal damage. I contacted Bellroy, showed them the images, and this is the response they sent me:

&#x200B;

*""Thanks so much for your patience and for confirming. We've reviewed the condition of your phone case from the photo and the area where the leather is peeled wouldn't be considered a manufacturing fault. Our production team has confirmed that this product is a full wrap leather product and unlike previous releases. To be clear, due to the construction of these cases, the leather we are using is thinner than the other cases which makes them less padded and have an increased risk of being damaged by other objects.""*

""*As such, putting the case on a rough surface, dropping them on soft/hard surfaces, or accidentally scratching them to a surface with a sharp object might end up with similar results. Based on the information provided this has been deemed as accidental damage from normal use so we're afraid that this isn't eligible for a warranty replacement.  I understand that this might be disappointing however we hope this doesn't stop you from continuing with us or loving future Bellroy.""*

&#x200B;

I basically got told from Bellroy that their case falling apart in 4 months is because they make it with cheap, thin leather, therefore this kind of wear is expected but it is not a manufacturing fault.....even though they manufactured it cheaply. OK, whatever, that is the first and last time I ever buy a Bellroy product, and I wanted to warn people here as well as see if anyone has had similar experiences with their cases?"

For those that don't know, if you set the timer to 3 seconds or 10 seconds, then the phone counts down and takes a single photo. This sucks when doing group photos because someone always blinks.

With the timer set to AUTO, the camera waits until it detects facial expressions like a smile and will keep taking photos each time a smile is detected. Well, this worked perfectly, even with a large group of 12 adults and 10 kids. They were amazed when the camera snapped after we all said ""cheese"".

Edit : 1 day later

Hey there,

I decided to tell you about everything I know and have tested about the Buds Pro, that you don't have to search all my answers through the comments. You can find all the pictures and the mic test about them [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/w61knw/comment/ihbi45t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**,** or in the comments.

# How did I get them earlier ?

I just ordered them on Fnac. The ""Pre order"" state wasn't there when I ordered it, so they shipped it as a normal package.

# What's inside the box

When you receive your package, you will find in there the **carry case** where are the **Buds**. They are **already fully charged** (the Buds and the case) so you don't have to wait. You will also find **eartips** in a white tube, the instruction manual and the warranty one.

There's **no USB-C cable** in the box, so be sure to have one or have a wireless charger.

# Design and comfort

I thought first that Buds pro were **very large** as we saw on Google pictures but **they are clearly not that large**. I have small ears and they fit in (pictures in the link above) so I'm pretty happy with. You can lay down on bed with them even sleep.

**Buds Pro are definitely more confortable than the previous version** (I only owned the series A version). I wore them today for 6 hours without interruption and I don't have this little pain as I got with the series A. You completely forget them and **you also don't have the feeling of having your ears clogged**.

The case feels nice and is more round-shaped than the series-A one, so a little larger. When I put them on light, there is also less reflexion on Pro case.

# Are they secure ?

Buds pro feels less secure than the Series A, but **they are still secure.** I was afraid first about them falling while eating, walking, running, biking, etc... But they are clearly not ! **You can definetly wear them while doing your favorite sport, just be sure to use the right eartips and insert the buds until that they feel snug and sealed.**

# Touch controls

You can **do everything you could do with the Series A** (check the manual on the pictures). Except that you **can also control the volume by swipping the Buds** and that pressing the Buds for 2 seconds ~~will not activate the assistant~~ but the ANC mode.

# Audio quality

I can't describe the audio quality because I don't have the words for and every ears are different but they are better than the Series A.

If you need the **bluetooth codec**, it's **AAC**.

# Mic test

I'm not confortable talking English but I tried. I don't have the perfect voice to mic test but you still get some samples.

You can listen to the **4 samples** I did for you in the link above. **It has to be you to judge the microphone quality** because I don't care about the mic, I just need one who works well and where you can hear me clearly. They do it so they are fine for me.

I also went outside, took my bike and drove around. I called my mother while biking, there was some wind, but she said that she can hear me clearly.

# Latency

I tested the latency with Youtube and some games. **I didn't notice latency on Youtube**, but I think that normal. There's also no latency using my computer and playing some battle royale games as Fortnite and Naraka Bladepoint. Otherwise, **on some games** like Geometry Dash, Arcaea, **you can notice a lag between the image you see and the sound you hear...** I just tested those games, if you have more apps, or games, to ask me to try, just tell me.

# Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode

**ANC works pretty well.** I can't compare it with other device because I don't own earbuds with ANC, except the Bose 700 I got when there was Pixel 6 preorder. But ANC works. Just need to press one earbud for 2 seconds.

If ANC is not activated, then the Transparency Mode will be active and it is a really really great mode. **You can hear all your surrounding** (voices, vehicles, noises, etc...) without taking off your Buds and **slightly louder than usual**. Even my voice was louder than usual lmao.

FYI, you can't active both mode at the same time.

# Multipoint Mode

You can definitely **connect the Buds Pro on two devices**. Even on a Windows computer. I didn't test on Mac because I don't own one, but I'm sure they do too.

You can switch media pretty easily, but you have to be sure to pause or stop the media on the first device and then press play on the other.

I also tested the feature I was watching a video on Youtube and asked my family to call on my phone. It works, well just in this way for now. The media you are playing will pause automatically and your buds will switch to your phone that you can answer.

But I also tested when I was listening a media on my phone and then someone calls me on **Teams** or **Discord**. **Unfortunately** it doesn't pause the media on my phone, doesn't switch, and also you can't hear the bell of your computer. It will switch only if you are in front of your computer, see the call and answer it with your mouse. Maybe I did someting wrong...

# Google Assistant

Assistant works just by saying ""Hey Google"". ~~But~~ **~~I didn't find a way to activate it using the touch control~~**~~.~~ According to the manual, you have to choose between ANC control and Google assistant when you touch and hold the Buds. ANC control will be set by default. I'm sure you can change that using the Pixel Buds app, but it's not updated yet.

# Battery

The battery of the Buds Pro is great. It **lasts long**. I just wore them for 6 hours and they went from 100% to 30%. **Both buds** **discharge equally**. They still can have 1 or 2% of difference but it's random.

They c**harge up really fast tho**, I'm even surprised about how fast they are when charging up. Even the case wirelessly (I actually use the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen). You can use your Pixel 6 to charge them.

# Connection Issues

I didn't have connection issues for now.

# Is it worth the upgrade ?

I was particularly afraid about the Buds was not secure at all, large that you can't lay down with them and that I will keep the Series A in this cases. But I was completely wrong. I can get rid off my Series A, get rid off the little pain in my ears and give it to my family. So, in my opinion they are worth and also because you can control the volume using the touch control. I will not make a Youtube video about them because I don't have the confidence for it, I let all experimented Youtubers do it when they can.

If you are in low budget, you can still get the Series A, they are really great too.

That's what I tested with the Buds Pro, I hope that helps you to choose if you want to keep your first version, your Series A or if you want to upgrade it. Excuse my English too, I'm doing my best for you beside I'm French.I'm gonna enjoy them for a while now ! If you need more pictures, more samples, or others questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment.

GooglePixel,Is anyone else's Google (or I guess even Android) having things spoiled by news article notifications?,"This post contains SPOILERS FOR ENDGAME. STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT

So while I've seen Endgame already, I keep getting Discover article notifications about serious spoilery things that happened in the movie. I don't know if Google knows I've seen it already, but had I not and this had happened it would have ruined the ending for me. Things like ""An Ode To RDJ"" really leave no room for misinterpretation.

Anyone else having this problem? Or is Google really 40000 IQ and knows I saw the movie by now so it isn't being a dick?

The widget already shows active timers/stopwatch, the weather, flashlight if on, ETAs about commute, battery level for some connections, and some more.

It should do much much more, I hope google revamp it to utilize the dead space it creates on the right as well as add many more customizations that also apply to the lock screen and AOD.

I would like it to feature turn by turn navigation from google maps, media control (if anything is playing), maybe upcoming alarms and reminders, and whatever useful features they come up with.

What do you think about this and what features and integrations would you like to see the widget support?


Edit: typo"
GooglePixel,Had a chance to mess around with the pixel 4 xl for a few hours. Here are my thoughts.,"Smooth motion is great, but you still notice the usual Android stutterness (is better overall due to the higher refresh rate) 

To be honest, I'm a huge high refresh pixel peeping human, and if anyone was wanting to upgrade to this phone based on that feature alone, I would reconsider. 

Motion sense is gimmicky sure, but works flawlessly and I can see myself just doing this on drives (even though I can just press the button on the steering wheel). It's cool 😎 Motion sense does work with the screen off (I had ambient display on during my testing).

Motion sense also works great for checking phone status (like the moto phones from back in the day).

Motion sense also has a nice sleek animation when it's activated (you can see it on the top bar if you view the video).

Oled was on the warmer side, didn't test for black crush. Hopefully it's better with burn in VS my current pixel 3.
Didn't seem that much brighter at max brightness vs my pixel 3. Maybe 50nits?

Works with the pixel stand just like the pixel 3.

Felt like initially setting up face unlock was a bit harder than needed. Seems to be really picky about how you tilt your head. Works flawlessly and is so much faster than face unlock on the iPhone.

One thing that was quite annoying (for me) is that you'll either need to press the power button or wake up the phone (via motion sense, lift to wake, double tap) to activate faceunlock. I did manage to get this to work via just the ambient display and looking straight at it, but was incredibly inconsistent. I can see why this would not be an option due to accidental unlocks.

Camera honestly looks the same to me VS the p3 (sorry no samples). Front facing is wider by default (p3 slightly wider), but honestly good enough. No wide angle for the back camera (already confirmed I think). Didn't test video (sorry).

Build quality is solid. Best hardware by Google so far on these phones. 
The extra 2 gigs of ram is really helpful. Thank you Google lol. Performance is what you'd expect (smooth at launch, hopefully it stays that way). I'm looking at you Google.

Speakers sounded better to me vs my P3. Take that with a grain of salt though, everyone's ears are different.

Didn't test the haptics everyone sorry! Pretty sure it was turned off ;__;

Final thoughts. Doesn't feel like a necessary upgrade if you already own a pixel 3. I'll be upgrading  due to my dad needing a new phone, but otherwise I'd wait for the 5 or a nice sale! OG users, upgrade away. P2 users, maybe wait for a sale too, but if you need a new phone asap and you want a pixel, upgrade away.

Edited: No comment on the battery. Had it for a short duration.

Edited: Squeeze is there, and it felt better to me vs my 3.

If there are any other specific questions, let me know.

Edit: https://streamable.com/cok1b (proof - motion sense on spotify)

GooglePixel,"Exclusive: Pixel will be able to stream Android apps to your Chromebook/PC, here’s how it works",
GooglePixel,Google really does have the worst customer service (rant),"I have a Pixel 4 XL that I purchased, new, when it came out last October (it's been in a case since day one, and it has never been dropped).

Back in August, I woke up one morning and saw that the phone hadn't charged (it was on a Pixel Stand).  I thought, ""that's weird,"" and took it off the charger and placed it back on.  Nothing.  I have 8 wireless chargers throughout my house and tried all of them; sometimes the Pixel 4XL would start charging, but within a minute or two would stop, and sometimes it wouldn't start charging at all.  Charging via a USB-C cable plugged into the phone still worked.

I also have an iPhone, so I tried the iPhone on the Pixel Stand and all the other wireless chargers, and it charged on all of them with no issues.  So the issues was definitely the Pixel 4XL, not the chargers.

So I call Google.  Or more accurately, I put in a request to receive a call.  Eventually get connected with someone and I explain the situation, and I ask if I can get a replacement phone sent to me since it's been less than a year and the phone is under warranty.  I am told no, that is not an option, and that the only option available to me is to go to a physical Ubreakifix location.  I explain to the guy that we are in the middle of a pandemic and that I would feel safe if Google could send me a replacement phone (I told him I'm fine with Google taking my credit card number in case I don't send the malfunctioning one back).  He says no, my only option is to physically take the phone in.  I ask if I have to take it in that day or if I can wait, and he said he'll create a case/claim for me and that I can take it in anytime.  I ask him if it'll still be valid if I wait to take it in until it's safer, even if it's after the warranty expires.  He says yes.  I triple check and ask him if I wait until November or December and take it in if it will still be valid for repair/replacement, and he says yes.

So I wait.  And the pandemic situation does not improve.  So I keep waiting.

Yesterday, I decide that despite the pandemic, I will try taking it to the Ubreakifix store.  I go there, and  after speaking with the guy who works there, he says he can't find any case/claim for me.  He looks it up by IMEI, my phone number, and my name.  Nothing.  He says I have to call Google.

So I come home, request another call from Google, and it says I will get a call in less than a minute.  15 minutes later, I get a call saying that they can't take any calls, goodbye.  WTF.  So I wait until today.  I make another request to get a call from Google.  It says I will get a call in less than a minute.  17 minutes later, still no call, so I try submitting another request.  They say a request already exists.  After 35 minutes, I finally get a call with a message saying that someone is on the line ready to talk to me.  *Another* 32 minutes later, someone finally comes on the line.

I explain everything to her and she asks what I was doing when the issue first happened.  I ask her if there are any notes from the first time I called back in August, and she says that there are, but that she wants updated information.  What?  If she can read what I was doing when it first happened, how could I update her on what I was doing when it first happened?  So I tell her the same thing, and she says I was offered a replacement back in August.  What?!?  I tell her it makes no sense that I would be offered a free replacement, would then *decline* that free replacement, continue to live with a malfunctioning phone, and then call back 4 months later to request that same free replacement.  She says she understands and will update the notes.

She then says she's going to put me on hold to see what the options are, since the warranty has expired.  Then the call disconnects.

She had taken my number at the beginning of the call so she can call me back if the call gets disconnected.  It's now been over 30 minutes and no callback.

Fuck Google.

# UPDATE

Firstly, thank you to all those with sympathetic words and for sharing your Google support stories, good and bad.  Secondly, thanks for the award! Thirdly, here is what has gone on since I posted this yesterday:

OK, so after posting this, I continued doing research online, and came across this page (about 30 minutes before another Redditor replied to my post with the same link, thank you to whomever that was!) on Google's support site about an extended repair program specifically for the Pixel 4 XL and power/charging/battery issues: [1-year extended repair program for Pixel 4 XL](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10169830?hl=en&ref_topic=7223822)

(As an aside, interestingly enough, if you take the title of the Google support page, ""1-year extended repair program for Pixel 4 XL"" and do a Google search for it, at least the first 50 results do not have that page as a result (I stopped clicking through after the 5th page).  Coincidence?  🤷🏻‍♂️🤔🤨🧐😏)

From that page: ""To check if your Pixel 4 XL is eligible for repair, you can bring your device to the nearest uBreakiFix location""  Which pisses me off.  Firstly, why didn't the Google support person I spoke with back in August tell me about this?  Secondly, why didn't the Google support person I spoke with two days ago tell me about this?  Thirdly, why didn't the Ubreakifix person tell me about this two days ago?

So I call the Ubreakifix store and talk to someone different and ask about this program specifically, and am told, ""oh yeah, Google has this program for the Pixel 4 XL.""  When I ask why the other Ubreakifix employee didn't tell me about this, he says he doesn't know.  I give him my IMEI number, he looks it up, and says it qualifies (obviously, since it's a one-year extension on a one-year warranty, and every Pixel 4 XL in existence is less than two years old).  So I go back to the Ubreakifix store, and he says it might just be a loose glass back because of faulty adhesive.  He says I have to come back the next day.

I go back today evening and he tells me it's actually a swollen battery which caused the glass back to rise *just* enough that it's not visible to the eye but the wireless charging contacts were not... making contact.  He said that while he sees battery swelling in Samsung phones the most, he does rarely see it on Pixel phones and iPhones.  They try to charge me $60 for the repair, even though they had confirmed yesterday that it would be covered.  So I had to explain again that it was covered, they had to check with a manager, etc... and quickly gave the phone to me without me having to pay.

In the meanwhile, after posting this yesterday and taking my phone in to Ubreakifix, I get one email yesterday and another one this afternoon from Google.  Yesterday's was from some generic Google support person, and this afternoon's was from the person I spoke with yesterday when our call got ""disconnected"".  She only tried to reach out to me, more than 24 hours after our call got disconnected, and after I found that extended repair program on my own, and took the phone in to Ubreakifix.  Both of those emails were saying they needed more information to process a review of my case for the ""Advanced Hardware Support"" team.  🙄 Still zero mention of the extended repair program.

Still, fuck Google."
GooglePixel,Yet Another Pixel 5 Review - from a long time Pixel user.,"If you had asked me 2 weeks ago whether or not I was considering purchasing a Pixel 5, I would have said no. There was nothing wrong with my Pixel 4 XL, and nothing about the 5 has jumped out at me as being a 'must have' feature.

But I walked into a local tech retailer and they had a big display set up for them. I had a play around on the demo unit - and long story short I ended up buying one.

For context, my history with the Nexus/Pixel line: Nexus 4 > Nexus 5 > Nexus 6p > Pixel 2 XL > Pixel 4 XL > Pixel 5.

Here are my unbiased, unabashed thoughts after using the Pixel 5 for just under a week, which are largely going to be framed with comparison to the Pixel 4 XL.

**BUILD QUALITY**

I love the feel of the Pixel 4 XL. I'm also terrified of using it without a case because of the copious amounts of glass and scratch-prone aluminium that surrounds it. Even though I wanted to use it naked, I kept a case on it 90% of the time.

The size of the P5 feels great in the hand - its small, but not cripplingly so, and feels safe to use without a case. The texture of the 'bio-resin' finish is pretty unique, and to be honest I'm not 100% sure if I like it or not yet, but it's grippy, doesn't scratch, and from what I can tell, is easy to clean.

The flat glass on the front is a welcome addition, and everything about the handset seems to fit together well. There aren't any gaps, the buttons don't wobble - basically, no complaints.

**DISPLAY**

The P4XL's display is fantastic. Probably the best I've seen on any device so far. After a few days on the P5, I can say that the screen is good, but not as good as the P4XL's. While the displays are similar, the higher PPI on the P4XL screen makes it look that little bit sharper when compared side to side.

That said, the difference is *only* stark when compared side by side. For daily use it won't matter. The P5's display is not at all poor, it's just not as good as it could be.

The smooth display also works well. This feature was also on the P4XL and it worked well there too, so there's not much to say about this. It's there, it works, it's good.

All that having been said, the P5's display gets extra points because of the way that they've utilised the ENTIRE front of the phone, rather than having uneven bezels. Much of this is due to them doing away with Project Soli, but I could count on one hand the number of times I actually made use of that on the P4XL, so I'm not losing any sleep over it.

**PERFORMANCE**

This was the big question mark I had for the P5, given Google's choice to revert to the SD765G. I'm a medium to heavy user. I make a reasonable number of calls each day, I use FB/Reddit/Instagram/Snapchat, play the occasional game, and lean on my phone heavily for photos, and the editing of said photos.

In short, I can barely tell the difference between the P4XL and P5. The only area in which I've noticed a significant difference is the processing of photos, due to the P5 not having the Neural Core that was in the P4XL for dedicated image processing. We're not talking having to wait forever, but in my side by side tests, the P4XL would process in 1-2 seconds what the P5 takes sometimes 3-5 seconds to process.

Some apps take ever so slightly longer to load on the P5, and I've had to restart the phone once because something weird happened and everything froze up, but apart from that it's been smooth as butter. 

It's worth noting that there have been a few moments where, under heavy use, the handset starts to get warm, where I never had any such issue on the P4XL.

**BATTERY**

So, full disclosure, battery life is never really a big deal to me. My home desk has a wireless charger, my work desk has a wireless charger, my car has a USB charger...basically I'm never far from power if needed. BUT...

Battery is where the P5 is beginning to shine. This thing just goes and goes and goes. I realise I'm still in the first week of use, so the performance will degrade slightly, but the P5 has a noticeably and significantly longer battery life than any other phone I've ever used. 

I had it on my bedside table playing videos when I went to bed last night, and have been using it for work this morning. My SoT on this charge is currently sitting at 2hrs 45mins, and the battery is at 84%. It hasn't been on charge since around 8:30pm last night.

This is with everything set up pretty much as default. Smooth display on, auto brightness, all notifications on. Not much else to say, battery is great.

**CAMERA**

Here's the big one. To cut right to the chase, I think the P4XL's camera is better.

Obviously with the P5, you have the advantage of the wide angle lens, which you don't get and can't replicate on the P4XL, but then you miss out on the telephoto lens with the P5. For which one is better - it really depends on which lens you think you'll get more use out of.

The P5 camera is fine. For 95% of people it'll do the job and produce really great looking photos, especially in well-lit environments. However as soon as I took side by side photos with the P4XL, there was just a bit more clarity, sharpness and (in my opinion) better balance in the P4XL's photos.

Again though, this is largely going to be a case of whether or not you prefer a Telephoto or Wide-angle lens. 

One last thing - if you're concerned about video, the P5 is the winner hands down. The P4XL's video is pretty average. The P5's 4k60 recording, and features like cinematic pan and the plethora of stabilisation options offer a much better video experience.

**MISC**

A few comments on things that didn't really fit into other categories.

* I much prefer the fingerprint sensor over face unlock. The sensor is in a spot that just makes so much sense, and it feels comfortable. It's also lightning quick every time, where sometimes the face unlock wouldn't recognise me.

* I'm not a huge fan of the vibrating-under-the-glass speaker setup. It works well enough, but I don't think it's as loud as the normal speaker on the P4XL.

* The size is really interesting. I was prepared to dislike the P5 immediately because I was used to a much bigger phone, but the reality is that due to the way they utilise the space on the screen (ie. no bezels), the screen itself isn't THAT much smaller, despite the phone itself having a much smaller footprint.

**SO AM I KEEPING IT, OR GOING BACK TO THE P4XL?**

Honestly, I don't know yet. The P5 has a lot going for it, despite the naysaying from much of the community and vocal critics.

It has drawbacks, sure, but for what you're paying, I'm not sure they're really going to be the end of the world - for transparency, I paid $990 AUD for the P5, and $650 AUD for the P4XL (I exploited a limited time offer one of our providers was offering on the P4 line in anticipating of the P5 release).

The more I use the P5, the more I am coming to like the form factor, the feel, and especially the display. Words cannot express how much zero bezels makes a difference.

I still have two and a half weeks before I need to make a final decision, but at this point if I had to choose, I'd probably sacrifice the few aspects of the P4XL that are superior in favour of the excellent design and overall feel of the P5.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far - happy to answer any questions you might have!"
GooglePixel,January 2020 Android Security Update Now Available for Pixel Devices,
GooglePixel,Those that have ordered - ignore the naysayers and enjoy your phone,"I'm still enjoying a Pixel 2 XL, which if you'll rewind a couple of years was getting shat on left right and center for all manner of reasons. Some justified, some not so much.

What I can tell you is that 2 years on, my 2 XL is the best phone I've ever owned, despite what this sub would have had you believe at time of release.

It's a Pixel, so:

- It's already running Android 10 and is smoother and faster than ever for it.
- The camera still bests or equals most of what is out there today.
- In spite of temptation, the experience is still so good that I'm still not tempted to upgrade (prior to this phone I've been upgrading every year since before smartphones were even a thing). Will probably wait until P4XL is cheaper next year, or may even wait it out until P5.

Enjoy your new phones everyone."
GooglePixel,Ugh Pixel Stolen By Shipper,"My fiance pre-ordered a Pixel 4a, he is not the type to spend money idly but he's having problems with his current phone and it doesn't take very good photos. Being the Google-phile that I am, I suggested the Pixel 4a, I know it will take great photos and provide him with smooth user experience. He was so excited to get his new phone, we waited quite a while but today was the day. To be honest, I was excited too, I've never owned a Pixel myself and wanted to see how the user experience stacked up against my S10 Plus. Well he opens the box only to find out that there is no phone inside, just the adapters, and cables. The shipping box looks to have been retaped and the Pixel box's seals have been cut. This indicates to us that the phone was stolen during shipping, apparently this isn't the first time this has happened, as there are a couple of posts elsewhere on Reddit detailing similar experiences. He's on the phone with Google's customer support right now so hopefully we can get this resolved in a timely manner. Will update you guys when it's all resolved. I just feel really bad for him right now and wanted to vent. Thanks for listening.

&#x200B;

Update: My fiance is finally off the phone will Google with no real resolution, they said they will conduct an investigation that's going to take between 24-48 hours to complete. They wanted him to send over some information on the box.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just want to thank everyone for all of the advice and supportive comments, it's definitely made us feel better. We will be reaching out to other outlets as soon as possible. "

I do, quite a bit. As a Pixel owner, I'm usually the one designated to take the group photos when with friends.

Doing this a few times, and always having to run back and forth to my phone to see if (1) the photo was taken (it's often hard to hear when with a noisy bunch) and (2) if everyone had their eyes open, has given rise to an idea that I think, potentially, Google would really like given that the two main selling points of the Pixel line are the camera and the Google Assistant.

What if Google Assistant got a ""photographer mode""? Imagine this:

Me: ""Hey Google, be my photographer.""

Pixel: ""Sure, I'll be your photographer!""

(At this point, GA opens my camera and uses all the Google machine learning smarts to analyze what it sees. If it seems that people are not all in frame, or someone's head is being cut off, it offers verbal feedback)

Pixel: ""I need you guys to scooch in a bit, you're not all in frame yet.""

(Once it sees everyone in frame, it snaps a shot)

Pixel: ""That was a good one! Let's try another one, okay? Are you ready?""

(Snaps another photo)

Pixel: ""I think we got it! Do you want to take another one just in case?""

Me: ""No thanks!""

Pixel: ""No problem"" (Exists ""photography mode"").

I know this could be considered pretty advanced, but to be honest I don't see why Google can't start doing something like this with what they already have. I mean, you can already ask the assistant to take photo. It's more just the fact that you always have to take at least 2-3 photos to get a good one, right?

I don't know, I may be way off, but come one, I think this would be a killer feature! Who agrees?"
GooglePixel,The Pixel 2 is the best phone I've used to date,"The past week or so I went through 3 new phones, all of which were so broken they were sent back the same day we got them. Then I suggested a Google Pixel phone because a friend suggested it and we scoured eBay and found one we could collect the same day. We found a Pixel 2 for £140 and we thought we may as well give it a shot.

Oh my god. I'm only on the second day of using it and I'm already in love with it. The phone is super fast even when running a demanding game, the fingerprint scanner is in a convenient location, the camera is crystal clear especially for 2019 and the battery life is really good

It is seriously the best phone I have ever put my hands on and it makes me sad I didn't invest in Google Pixel at first. Needless to say I am now commited to Pixel and I love Google even more

EDIT: This got more upvotes than I expected and I'm kinda surprised. Thanks to everyone for all the comments it makes me feel not alone. I'm steadily falling in love with my phone more and more"

GooglePixel,Pixel 4 XL second opinion review: The Android phone I can't stop using,
GooglePixel,"6/6 pro owners that use fingerprint unlock--how many times a day do you experience where you have to enter your PIN, with the notification that ""the phone has been locked manually""?","On my 6 pro it happens at least 6-12 times a day.  The message wording bugs me (""locked manually""--no, no I did not manually lock it), but this happens far more frequently than any of my previous pixels.  Is there something I can look into?

Edit--I don't have a screen protector installed, and my FP scanning has not been problematic at all on my phone.  Just to be absolutely clear, it's not because my FP scanner cannot scan my finger properly; mine has been very reliable and i haven't had issues with it being slow.  This is the ""pin needed for extra security"" that previous versions of Android would call it.  I do use trusted devices, as others have mentioned maybe that's a place to look into."

I was at a graduation ceremony today when at 2 o'clock, my phone sent me a notification that said, ""Your movie tickets are today at 2:30.""

I was able to call the theater, tell them my mistake, and transfer the tickets to the day I had intended.

When I show them the wrist flick to switch between forward and rear facing, when they see how well a shot comes out in weird lighting, it's hysterical. A few nights ago we got some group shots, under super bright soccer field lights. The group was made up of skin tones ranging from red head white to ebony black and everyone looks fabulous in the photo!

Love this camera!"

GooglePixel,"Those Pixel phones might be awesome, but Google support sure ain't ...","I am currently going through some of the worst online shopping  experience I had in my life, all because I purchased a phone through Google's own web store. What happened is that the phone I bought (P7p) was not in the delivered package and 2 weeks into raising a case with Google support I get the same answer from Support - ""We ask you for your patience, while we investigate the matter""... Well I paid almost a 1000 euro for a phone and my patience is wearing thin...

Consider twice where you buy your phone as Google absolutely doesn't care about customer service as it has proven time and time again...

EDIT: Wow, didn't actually expect the discussion that I stirred here, but I think the overwhelming majority clearly shares the sentiment that Google is clearly not doing enough to support their customer base. 

I actually sent the Reddit thread back to the last tier of support, where there is a higher chance of it not getting buried. I know a lot of you will say, that this is a useless exercise, however I do think that feedback from the hundreds of comments on this thread is valuable to companies like Google and for sure they have managers monitoring social media for posts like this, so don't feel like you are screaming into the void.

GooglePixel,Trade-in phone value reduced from $240 to $37,"Update: I will receive the full refund, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/l257s7/update_about_my_pixel_2_tradein_240_to_37_reduced/).

[I posted this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/88elad/status/1351220733695959044), but I think I should also post this here.

On Black Friday weekend there were aggressive advertisements suggesting to trade-in a phone and get a Pixel 4a 5G for a reduced price. In my case, it said that for my Pixel 2 128GB, I would get a refund of $240. I read on this subreddit warnings that said that Google might lower the value of the phone with no reason and that this would be non-negotiable, but I didn't believe this would actually happen. 3 years ago I traded-in a Nexus 5X for my Pixel 2 128GB and got the full refund ($115).

Last Wednesday I received an email saying that my phone value has been reduced to $37. It said that they found at least one issue that affects the value of the phone. However, they reported that the phone turns on, the screen has no cracks, and that it has been factory reset. I contacted their support team in order to understand what is the issue. This morning I received an email saying that the phone screen doesn't turn on and that the ports of the were damaged. I replied with a video which I took right before sending the phone, showing it turning on. I also sent the phone in the box in which I received the Pixel 4a 5G for extra protection, to avoid damage to it on the way. Unfortunately, I didn't take a video of the phone charging, so I can't prove that the ports weren't damaged, but you can see in the video (on Twitter) that the phone is fully charged. The support team offered me $50 in Google Store credit, which I refused to accept.

This is a shame, I never imagined any thing like this happening, and this is probably going to be the last Google phone I'll ever own. For those of you who are considering Google's trade-in plans, I would strongly suggest to avoid them."

GooglePixel,Android watch ecosystem really needs a Google Pixel Watch. My Samsung Galaxy Watch Active died today and I looked for something new and it honestly doesn't seem like anything has changed in the last couple of years.,"I bought a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active a couple of years ago because my Pebble was showing its age and Rebble wasn't cutting it anymore. I just wanted something waterproof, lasts at least 2-3 days, easy to use, and gives me notifications. I'm probably easier to please when it comes to features than most people. It did the job just fine imo.

It died recently, the screen just wont turn on. I decide to look at my options and it honestly feels like the same exact things are on the market...and they're all mediocre. I can't stomach spending another $150 to buy the same exact watch that barely lasted 2 years. Its $200 for the Galaxy Watch Active 2 but even then...$200 bucks doesn't seem worth it for something that I really just mean to buy as a stopgap before I buy the ""unicorn Pixel watch"". Fitbit's offerings are mediocre for the price. IMO Apple is eating everyone's lunch because there's no real alternative to it on the Android side...unless you totally buy into Samsung's ecosystem."
GooglePixel,S10 review from Pixel user,"Would there be any interest in a review on the s10 from a frequent Pixel user?

I know a lot of us are frustrated by the latest bugs as well as the lackluster delivery of the 3. And although the March update had fixed many issues I feel many of us are looking to test the waters on other devices.

I'm no MKBHD, but I have used all 3 Pixel devices, having been consistently on Pixel since my 2XL. I've also tested the 3XL against the iPhone XS Max and Note 9 previously. So now having an opportunity to test the S10+ I have the chance to give an honest review from a Pixel user perspective.

Would anyone be interested in a full review? I just received mine yesterday so it would be at least a week or more to get the full experience.

TLDR; I'm a full time Pixel user with an S10+ and want to do a review.

EDIT: Since this post is starting to really gain traction, are there any areas that you guys would like to focus on? The main areas I'm planning on currently are: screen, camera, battery, UI, customization, settings, performance (this will include speed, memory leaks, apps force closing, and responsiveness), Samsung vs Google apps (such as pay, bixby, etc), and general impressions.

I'll test anything you guys are interested in knowing.

EDIT2: Damn this post has really blown up. I won't let you guys down. I'm expecting to write the review by or around next Saturday. Since I'm a heavy user I expect to have a good idea by then.

GooglePixel,OG Pixel Unlimited Photos Storage: Syncthing Guide,"With June around the corner, millions of users will lose access to unlimited High Quality Photos storage. If you have an OG Pixel or are willing to spare double-digits dollars, you can easily sync your new phone's captures to your old Pixel for unlimited backup at Original Quality. Below I'll describe how I use [Syncthing-Fork](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid) to automatically and instantly sync photos with insignificant battery drain. We'll also touch on battery maintenance for the OG Pixel, such as cycling the battery with a smart plug, [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm), and [AutoInput](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoinput).

---

#Installation and Folder Selection 

[Syncthing-Fork](https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android) is a ""Syncthing Wrapper for Android."" I originally used the official app but battery drain was consistently high and the connection was not stable. The fork resolved both issues for me. Install Syncthing-Fork on both phones so we can select the relevant folders. 

Open the app and hit `Menu (☰) > Web GUI > + Add Folder > General`. 

* `Label` your folder whatever, e.g. ""Camera""
* `Path` to the relevant folder, e.g. `/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera` 

Go to the `Ignore Patterns` tab to exclude things. I don't sync thumbnails (high frequency changes) or photos queued for deletion (unimportant) and input `*thumbnail*` and `*trashed*` on separate lines in the text box. You may also add paths to subdirectories that should be ignored, such as `Messenger`. Note the operator guide under the text field.

Finally, go to the `Advanced` tab:

* `Type` as ""Send Only"" so external devices can't modify your new phone's files
* `Pull order` ""Oldest First"" because ??? This is unimportant because syncing occurs so frequently that your pool is only 1-2 items. 
* `Save`

Repeat the above steps for additional folders except do not repeat individual `Ignore Patterns` because we can do it globally later. Finish adding your folders. Remember that subfolders ARE included. Each sync'd folder will contain `.stfolder` and other `.stremoved*` files. Removing these files will break your sync. To fix, simply replace the removed file with one of the same name. Learn more about ignoring files [here](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/ignoring.html).

I sync the following folders

* `/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera`
* `/storage/emulated/0/Movies/`
* `/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/`

If you created a folder and specified `Ignore patterns`, you should have a '.stignore' file in your `/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera` folder. Copy that to your root direction (e.g. `/storage/emulated/0/`). Open `.stignore` with a text editor and it should look like this:

> `**.thumbnails`  
> `(?d)**thumbnail**`  
> `**.trashed*`    
> `**.tmp`

Right now, it will ignore any files and folders with those terms in their names. Please modify however you want per the linked documentation above. Include directories with respect to the root directory (e.g. `!(?d)/Movies/Messages`).

---

#Syncing to OG Pixel

On your new phone, `Syncthing-Fork > Menu (☰) > Show device ID`. On your OG Pixel, `Syncthing-Fork > Devices (tab) > Add Device (top right)`. Tap the QR code button to scan your new phone.

* `Name` it whatever
* `Introducer` enabled because your new phone will introduce stuff
* I think there was an accept all folders options, or maybe it was in the GUI, Idr.
* Go to Web GUI

I kinda ran out of steam for this section so ask in the comments if you have trouble. The GUI is pretty straightforward so you should get the hang of it by now.

#Battery Health Maintenance

Chargie is one option. Kinda pricey, would not recommend.

The absolutely best method requires you have a bootloader unlocked OG Pixel so you can install [acc by VR25](https://github.com/VR-25/acc/releases) alongside [AccA by MatteCarra](https://github.com/MatteCarra/AccA/releases). This method will allow you to directly power the device and bypass the battery entirely. If the device loses power, it will revert to battery. Unfortunately my version is from Verizon (but was only $60 mint condition) so I had to use Tasker and AutoInput.

Install Tasker/AutoInput, then go through the setup and accessibility and write secure adb stuff. Each app will walk you through how to do it.

Create two Tasker profiles with state = `power` and source = `AC`, and toggle `Invert` for one. First profile is `Invert` and turns on the plug when your battery drops too low. Second profile turns off the plug upon your specified charge level.

GooglePixel,Android 11 Beta 2 Now Available for Pixel Phones!,

GooglePixel,Hidden Android 11 feature adds double-tap gesture to the back of Pixel phones,
GooglePixel,Pixel 6 Pro don't seem to get the same treatment as other brands.,"TL; DR: S22 series release and reviews made me appreciate my 6 pro even more and start questioning reviewers bias and the state of the smartphones market.

Stay with me, it is a pixel post, although the S22 reviews made me write this.

I've watched a few reviews about the S22 series and they look great, love the matt glass and really wish google did this for the 6 Pro. 

However there's one review I was waiting the most for and that's MKBHD's one. Beautiful videos, lots of details etc and I kind of tend to feel he is not that biased about android brands(under question now).

His S22 review left me with a mixed bag of feelings. Not a single mention of price to specs ratio. You get a 1080p screen, not a LTPO screen, not really a camera upgrade on paper with a marginal actual quality improvement of photos. 

What really annoyed me though was his comment on battery life. 4.5 hours of screen on time in about 29 hours off the charger and he said that's good. I don't know how many of you remember, but his pixel 6 pro got 4-5 hours of SoT and he called it trash, while the phone is 100£ cheaper than the S22+ and you get way better spec on paper and reality. This is not even to mention the fact that I believe he got a lemon as lots of people have great battery life on their 6 pro's and I personally get around 6-7 hours SoT with 30% left before going to bed.

It really bothers me that, because phones are considered flagships, price doesn't matter anymore. How does one justify paying more money, for less specs and does not even mention it. Not even talking about the ultra which is 400£ more and you don't really get anything more apart from the pen (which I think is really cool nonetheless). I feel like price should be important as paying hundreds more for marginal upgrades is crazy. It supports the idea that companies can keep increasing prices, because people will see them as more premium, when in reality it offers barely anything. 

In my opinion Google hit the nail with the pixel 6 series (yes, both the regular and the pro), because I can hardly find a phone nowadays that offers as much as the pixel while still being ""affordable"". Heck, even the ""a"" series are getting a lot better now with the improved design, no compromises on the processor side as well with the Tensor and great cameras. 

To finish this rant - I think major reviewers should consider the price of a phone more, rather than just them being flagships and comparing them all together. There's a huge difference between paying 850 and 1300 for what seems marginally better products."

GooglePixel,Just played with the Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro at Best Buy,"My local Best Buy had the 7 and 7 Pro on display. I was able to spend some time checking them out. Here are my thoughts and things to note. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to help. For comparison I cannot comment on how they compare to the 6 and 6 Pro in terms of camera and performance, considering I only had my 4 XL on me. I was unable to test anything battery, or unlocking wise.

**Design/Hardware**

Both devices are nice, and feel premium. I was a tad underwhelmed though, because they seem very similar to the 6 & 6 Pro devices. The size of the 7 feels perfect, and I much prefer the flat display. The 7 Pro curved sides have been reduced from the 6 Pro last year so that's a good improvement. The Obsidian/black model was the only one on display. It picks up a lot of fingerprints, and feels like the same finish as the 6 series. I'll be curious how the Snow and Hazel colors compare. The 7 camera bar and side rails are matte, which I prefer. The 7 Pros looks nicer, but it's glossy which isn't for me. 

**Display**

Both devices are very bright. For the limited time I spent, I couldn't notice a quick difference between the 120 hz and 90 hz screens. 

**Camera** 

The 7 Pro selfie cam gives you a wider angle than the 7. The back camera can zoom in much further. On the 6 Pro I had owned, I often had issues with low light on the selfie camera. The processing would make you look like a water color painting. I'm a tad worried that the 7 and 7 Pro is using the same selfie camera, and will have the same issue. I could only test this in the store, so I do not know forsure how selfie photos will look in bad lighting situations. But from what I was able to capture, the selfies did not seem super sharp. I'd expect in sun light they will look very good as they have in the past. For the Macro Focus mode, I was unable to figure out how to use that on the 7 Pro. There wasn't anything obvious that said Macro in the camera app. I thought by focusing on something up close with the ultrawide lens would allow me to do that, but no help there. One thing I did notice as an upgrade from the 6 Pro to the 7 Pro, was on the 6 Pro as you zoom in on a subject, you could really notice when the camera switched from the main lens to the telephoto. On the 7 Pro, the switching of the lens is a lot more smooth, and less noticeable.


**Conclusion** The Pixel 7 ultimately is the better value. I'm someone who really cares about the camera specs, but for the 7 Pro you're essentially paying $300 for a telephoto lens, more RAM, and a larger battery. So if those matter to you, and you don't mind the 6.7 in display, then go for the Pro.

Something I'm also realizing with Pixels, is that unless you're upgrading to a device with major hardware upgrades, you're going to have a very similar experiences, since the software is so consistent and we all get software upgrades. I'd imagine iPhone users have similar experiences. If you want something that really feels new, then I'm starting to realize you're better off switching OS's or manufacturers.

What I'll be most curious from reviews are, do the overheating issues still exist, how's the battery, how's the face unlock compared to the Pixel 4, and has the fingerprint scanner improved at all.

GooglePixel,"Took years for my brother to try a Pixel phone, took 3 days for him to return it.","I've been a long time Pixel user, always told my brother (who's not into phones or tech at all) about the cool features Pixel phones had, the camera etc. He's always been a Samsung user, but he finally decided to check out the 6 Pro.

In three days he told me he's had multiple calls drop out, issues with the Pixel Stand 2 constantly asking him to realign the phone, the phone freezing on him and a couple of random reboots, the fingerprint is slow and doesn't read occasionally. This is all after the January patch has been installed. Then he looks online and finds out there's a tonne of people having the same issues he has and told me jokingly I made him buy a dud phone. I said there's been issues and Google are trying to fix them, but the issues he has been getting are serious and probably better just to go with a phone he hasn't had issues with.

He's has contacted Google and initiated return. I can't blame him.

This launch has really been a disaster for Google. If they wanted to make a push for more causal users to buy the phone, you can't have a product with this many serious issues. Consumers aren't just going to put up with it.

I myself am looking to move off the Pixel 6 Pro when the Galaxy S22U comes out. I like the phone, but with all the bugs, I'm not going to wait for Google to sort it all out."
GooglePixel,Does anyone actually miss the squeeze feature?,"I recently installed custom rom on my pixel 3 and there was an [Customize the squeeze (active edge)](https://i.imgur.com/qkfXHTm.jpg) to other options and I thought that it was really cool and underrated what developers could do , which google only gave us one option, I'm not saying squeeze to assistant is bad but if we had other options like this it would have been really useful."
GooglePixel,"Google should allow third party Icon Packs in their launcher, since they made other launchers somewhat unsuable.","I really like(d) to customize my homescreen and sadly (even though Google says different) it is getting worse with every new android version. 
Since the gesture came out, you are basically stuck with the default launcher if you want to use them fluidly which, in googles case, doesn't allow for other icon packs.
Since android 12, you can't even customize the shape of the icons anymore. That is probably the least way that I can customize my homescreen since whatever Android version.
I really like Monet and also the new icon designs however, it's only supported by some Google apps which makes it somewhat more ugly if a few apps are themed and the others are birght and have completely different colors. (An option that forces the other app icons to also adapt to the theme would be nice, I think that is even possible, since the adaptive Icons already have an icon in 2 layers).

But whatever, most of this would be fixed if Google allows for icon packs on the Pixel Launcher. I wouldn't need a third party launcher anymore, I could change the icon shape with an icon pack, and I could use an icon pack that uses Monet.

I have send feedback to the Pixel Launcher for years that they should add, but obviously they haven't. (They actually removed the feedback option lol).

Edit: 
Yes the gesture do work TECHNICALLY on other launchers. BUT the implementation is still far from as good as on the Pixel Launcher. There is always a small input lag after closing an app, before you can open another. The animation is somewhere where the icon is, but is still separate while the Pixel Launcher basically includes the app icon into the animation. It is still sometimes buggy, has some lag, doesn't work good with rotation.
I think it also depends on how fast and how often you open close apps, how detailed you look an animations and so on, if you find the third party gestures enough for you or not. But it is still not the same as the Pixel Launcher which I think it should be for a good experience."

GooglePixel,Don't kill Project Soli,"Project Soli is one of the coolest projects Google has created in the past decade. You can see how long the project team has been working on it from the videos on YouTube. It's been rumored that Project Soli will not be on the Pixel 5 line, and while that makes sense for now while it feels a little gimmicky, I implore Google to continue looking at the possibilities of this project. Putting a chip like this on a watch would be useful especially because watch screens aren't very large. Allowing other developers to play with the possibilities of this chip would also be great."
GooglePixel,"I tracked the amount of time it took to charge the new pixel buds from ~empty to full, here is the result!","[Plots](https://i.imgur.com/moMvli0.png)

I let the buds drain; this resulted in the right bud draining to empty while a the left bud still had 10%.  I then put them in the charging case and tracked the charge status at 1 minute intervals for the first 10 minutes, then every 5 minutes until the buds reached around 80%, then every minute after that.

* **They get about 20% charge in the first 5 minutes!!**  Then about 40% within the first 10 minutes.  This really is in line with Google's claim of 2h of use with 10 minutes of charge.


* From 0% to 100% took 47 minutes


* They charge most-rapidly up until about 80%, then charge rate levels off reaching 100%


* The case lost 18% to charge both buds back up, it should provide 5 full charges to the buds

The buds charge seriously fast.  Compared to my Galaxy buds it's not even a competition.

What is also interesting to note from this data is the discrepancy of power use between the buds.  I posted a thread yesterday about drain after an hour of use, and there was a 20% difference between the buds after an hour.  I guess this evens out over longer usage.

At the same time, with one bud dying and the other still having 10% left, you don't get the full usage out of them, which is a bit frustrating as a consumer.  On the other hand, personally, I never really use headphones for more than maybe 2 hours straight, and the fast charge rate means I never really have to worry about them (I don't know how long it took to drain, I just set them to play when going to bed and came back to them in the morning; on retrospect I wish I had set them to play back with long video, then I'd know how long it took based on where the video paused at...)."

GooglePixel,Pixel 3 Camera Comparison with iPhone 11 Pro,"[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/baVDP7w)

[Higher quality photos, more night photos, plus an example of the ultrawide iPhone camera.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oaZE8iBk7o8SDkUQ8) I may add more, subscribe and hit the notification bell to be notified if I do!

My Takeaways:

* The iPhone still can't match the Pixel when it comes to fine details like hair/fur/skin, nor can it freeze motion as well. Freezing motion is critical for taking photos of your kids.
* The Pixel struggles to grab focus in the dark, the iPhone doesn't hesitate.
* The iPhone still has a weird brown/orange hue to photos, but not as bad as previous models.
* The iPhone still overexposes, and really lacks contrast/shadows. It just kind of blanket brightens the entire image which makes it look washed out.
* The Pixel's front camera is a lot better than the iPhone's, particularly in handling dynamic range.
* Pixel night photos look more natural to me, the iPhone seems to just max out the sharpening slider which results in more detail but looks really bizarre. Very Samsungish.
* The iPhone's ultrawide camera is bad. Super soft even in the best lighting, looks like a potato in the dark.
* The iPhone is obviously more versatile. Better video and more cameras is very useful.

I really hope Apple's Deep Fusion can deliver a big jump in detail, because it still just isn't there compared to the Pixel."

There were some positive written reviews and one or two positive video reviews but there was also a TON of negativity from well respected tech people. Nevertheless, I decided to go through with the purchase since I was getting an insane trade-in value for my 4a 5G and free Pixel Buds A Series on top of that. I have been using the 6a for half the day now and I honestly have no idea why people are critical of it. I love the looks and the sorta sage color is just right IMO. The display isn't high refresh rate but it still looks great with vibrant color. The camera looks great so far. Best of all, it just runs SO MUCH FASTER than my 4a 5G. Everything feels snappier. The only thing I can't really comment on so far is battery life due to limited testing time. 

I honestly think that tech reviews have become so out of touch with what average consumers want and it's really frustrating to see a good phone get such a bad rap for being... Boring I guess? I get that the specs aren't quite as good as the 6 (but honestly they're pretty damn close) but THIS IS A MIDRANGE PHONE.

I have talked about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/n0pifs/update_on_my_refund_issue_with_google_for_my_lost/).

## I have added some updates for people who are suggesting chargebacks as an option, and also for people who think I am being impatient (which is subjective I think), and of course to people who think I am a fraudster. Also, I would like to point out that in no way do I think Google is not within their rights to investigate this, but for me this is more about customer experience, and my confidence in ever again ordering from Google vs any other brand (Amazon for e.g.). This isn't a case of something being delivered by UPS, and me contesting I never received it. The package has not been scanned since it reached UPS. It would require multiple people to screw up at various points to this being delivered to me, yet not reflecting on UPS record.

I ordered a Pixel 5, and UPS apparently lost the shipment. And even though UPS has confirmed that the package never reached me, Google is still refusing to refund my money.

I keep chatting with their team to get my refund. First 2 days, they would just tell me, ""we have escalated this, please wait"", when I would want to speak with the escalation agent, one chat agent told me no, and then disconnected the chat, even without waiting for a reply. Please note that at no point was I ever rude or abusive to anyone. I was slightly irate (rightfully so), but I just wanted some update.

After 2 days, UPS said they lost the package, but Google said they want UPS to complete an investigation before they will refund my money. Even though I as a consumer should not assume any responsibility of a shipping mishap, and the claims process with UPS is Google's job, apparently, Google likes to hold customer's accountable for delivery mishaps and takes zero financial liability.

If they would have just refund my money right away (like most companies would, when they failed to deliver a product), I would have gone and bought a Pixel 5, but now I would never want to deal with Google customer service again. Not only would I not buy a Pixel (or any Android phone), I have already cancelled my Youtube premium and music subscription as well. And also, the cloud infrastructure that I was planning to build (of all my data)

Imagine you ordered something from Uber Eats, and your food is not delivered, and you are hungry, and Uber says they are conducting an investigation before they can refund anything. This is basically just like that. I am out a $1000 dollars and all Google has given me is 1 email per day that ""we are doing everything we can"".

I understand things can go wrong with shipping, I also understand every company has its policies have, but   this is not a repair or a replacement (I can only imagine the horror of dealing with Google if there is ever a hardware issue). This was a case of a complete no show. Google issuing me a refund should not have depended on any investigation. This policy of their is highly unfair to the customers, and as far as I know is unheard of.

Yesterday I even got an email saying it was escalated to the ""highest tier of support"", and I thought wow, something would happen now, but it seems the answer is still the same - waiting for the investigation, and just more apology that they are literally holding my money without interest, for no reason apart from the fact that they don't want to pay me before UPS pays their claim.

I have been a long time Android/Google loyalist, but this ""fuck you"" policy of Google has made me realize why so many prefer Apple over Google. If it wasn't for the amazing products Google engineers make and the maps/asisstant/search/browser sync experience, absolutely no one would even think about buying Google products.

Edit 1: I cannot do a charge back, not unless I want to lose my Google account of more than a decade.

What is the timeline? Am I being just impatient? For people who want to know the exact timelines to understand whether I am being impatient, I guess whether I am being impatient, and how long is long enough is fairly subjective of course. Perhaps I am being unreasonable, or may be not. It all depends on what your experience of shipment generally is, and also how urgent is your requirement. So, I will mention the timeline here, and people can decide whether they think it's reasonable or not. Again, I don't think there is a right answer to this, and depends on each individual. It has been 1.5 weeks since the purchase, 1 week since the latest estimated delivery date, 1 week since the issue was escalated, and a little more than 1 week since UPS had any updates on their tracking. It took Google 3 days to initiate an investigation through UPS. I kept asking them if it is done, and they said it is, but when I would ask UPS, they would say they still haven't received a request for investigation. Now, I understand that UPS investigations take 10 business days, which is 2 weeks. Till now Google has not once confirmed that they will refund my money if the investigation is complete and it is finalized that I never received the phone. I asked them directly 2 times, and both times, all they have said is they will get back once the escalation is done.

Why should Google refund you based on just your word? Agreed, but this wasn't a case of product delivered, but I am contesting it is not. It wasn't even as if UPS just forgot to scan the package at the time of delivery. They haven't scanned it since it reached their warehouse. I agree they still need to do a thorough investigation to find what exactly happened to the package, but it certainly isn't a case of them delivering it, and me saying I haven't received it.

Why do I want a refund and not replacement? Because I would like to go out and buy a phone from somewhere else, and not wait for a replacement to be shipped. At this stage, I don't even want an immediate refund, I just need realistic timelines, so I know that if this is not refunded by my next billing cycle, how will I manage my finances if I buy another phone.

Why did I not buy it from BestBuy or Carrier in the first place if I was in such rush? Because neither of them had the Sorta Sage in stock, and I didn't anticipate that Google would take this long to get me a phone. In retrospect, yes, I would have just gone with the all Black, but at the time, I didn't anticipate this.

For all who are suggesting I am just trying to defraud Google. If even there is a way to defraud a company like Google (it's everywhere), it realistically would have taken a huge coordinated effort to pull something like this off. And all this for a phone??? Well, it's a possibility, but a very unrealistic one."

Yes, there was a Round 1 and Round 2, which I haven't even gone into.  What you see here is 'Round 3' only.

**Solution:** Write a letter to their Investor Relations and tweet u/MadeByGoogle (I have 0 followers and it still got a response).  In less than 24 hours, I got an email today saying ""My name is \_\_\_\_ and I am a higher level specialist that stumbled upon your case during a routine audit.""

**Letter & More Info are Seen here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQMRYHiEsUVnsITX3alXWTQyA\_0dIvzTOfS2ozNNJw1YiNmIFVvltqZfX8FzaTIUx42IuRAA1FRYalf/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQMRYHiEsUVnsITX3alXWTQyA_0dIvzTOfS2ozNNJw1YiNmIFVvltqZfX8FzaTIUx42IuRAA1FRYalf/pub)

The letter is pretty scathing, and I also called them out for something that I am fairly certain is illegal... I'm still debating on showing this to an attorney.

**End Result:** I'm never buying a Google phone again.  I'm getting used to a iPhone that was given to me, and I'm likely to stay iPhone at this point.  Once I receive the device, it's getting sold. Feel free to take a few pages out of my book to get the message across... Stand your ground if you know you're right... What a colossal waste of time.

 **What I would do if I had to do this shit all over again:** \#1: I wouldn't buy a Google phone at this point, and I still want to hear back from Investor Relations with an authentic answer. I hope one of their reps is reading this thread. #2: If you're out of warranty... I'd start off by doing what it says by ""asking your question to our Twitter account by tweeting '@MadeByGoogle' seen on the [1-year warranty info page](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/11833075?hl=en) \- they're better than any other basic customer support function and ""have a seemingly North American written response"" *if you know what I mean*... - I think either them or Investor Relations is what triggered the 'Customer Service Audit' where a Level 4 up specialist looked into my case, saw all the bullshit, and stepped in. In this thread, you'll hear people talking about their war stories and they mentioned resources like the BBB, the FTC, and maybe a few other channels. #3: I'd have your Date of Purchase, Date of Activation, Date of Issue, Original IEMI number (seen on the box), new IEMI number (if applicable), a picture/copy of your uBreakIFix receipts (keep ALL of them), and a link to the 1-year warranty page all handy at a moment's notice. You also need to explain to them that changing the motherboard changes the IEMI number, because they don't seem to get that... #4: Don't let them forward you to the ***Fi*** department (I bought from the *Fi store*)... The extended 1-year warranty is in the realm of the ***Pixel*** department. #5 - For you folks who have their phones completely bricked (no charging): The fix is the same as the black screen issue. It'll need a new motherboard. I think it'll be helpful for uBreakIFix to attempt a repair under the black screen warranty. Google can diagnose this as a ""power issue"" but my battery was never replaced and it magically started working again after the motherboard was replaced. Shocker, right? 

I hope this helps.

**EDIT #1:** The only thing I ""won"" was the battle. I'll be ""breaking even"" once I receive my phone. I ""lost"" my patience and a shitload of time, lol.

**EDIT #2:** The Radio is NOT under warranty; however, supposedly the radio is integrated into the motherboard (source: uBreakIFix) and when I'm getting a new motherboard, I'm getting a new radio along with it.  The Radio issue only came after the attempted black screen fix.

GooglePixel,I have a Google Pixel 5 - any questions?,"**Edit3:** I moved this to the top as I just want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone for the questions. I love tech writing and reviewing and I love being able to help people. Up until a few years ago, I relied heavily on unbiased reviews to decide whether or not it was worth it to spend the couple hundred I scraped together on particular devices. Since having the privilege of becoming a reviewer, I have undertaken the duty of trying to provide those unbiased opinions, and I really hope that's apparent from the work I do. I really hope you'll all enjoy the reviews I'm working on, and I'll still be checking this thread every now and again up until the reviews drop.

Hey guys!

So I have a Google Pixel 5 for review at XDA-Developers, and I wanted to reach out to the /r/GooglePixel community to see what questions you want answered. [I threw up some pictures on my Twitter if you want to check them out](https://twitter.com/AdamConwayIE/status/1314613190446252045), but I also wrote that hands-on article that's currently up on XDA too! 

Just a disclaimer: I can't *answer* any of your questions yet, but I'm currently in the course of writing my review and I'll try to cover as many of your questions as possible throughout it. So feel free to comment below, and anything I *can* answer currently I will answer!

Edit: Anything I don't answer at the moment I'm saving to cover in my full review! I'm just answering stuff I can for the moment - keep the questions coming :D Anything I can answer right now is basically anything that would be part of an ""unboxing"", so basically first five minutes impressions or so during setup and what's in the box, along with specs.

Edit2: Thank you for all the questions!! I'm currently scrolling through the thread and writing my review currently. Anything better suited to be answered individually once the review embargo lifts I'll come back and answer when I can! I'll still be keeping an eye on this thread as well for more ideas :)

GooglePixel,I’ve certainly tried.. but I can’t keep these thoughts to myself anymore..,"Little bit of a rant here and I’m sure I’ll get a flurry of downvotes but so be it. I received my Pixel 2XL today after anxiously waiting its arrival. I am switching from an iPhone 7 Plus. Just a little background I’ve had just about every flagship phone you can have within the past 6-7 years whether it’s Apple or Android. The reason being for this post is I just can’t comprehend or understand why everyone seems to be complaining and excuse my language but bitching about every little aspect of this phone possible. It got to the point where I had to go to Verizon multiple times after I preordered my phone because I was so worried about my purchase until I decided I’m so over hearing about everyone’s opinions I’d rather give it a test run myself and return it if I didn’t enjoy it.

GooglePixel,I've been testing Google Pixel 7 Pro — and it blows away the Galaxy S22 Ultra,
GooglePixel,Solved Pixel 3/3XL Performance Issues,"So, I have literally spent months trying different methods in attempts of fixing the Pixel 3 sluggishness and stuttering issues. I tried reboots, uninstalling unwanted apps, clearing the cache, full system wipes, etc but no matter what the performance issues would return.  A few days ago  I stared at my pixel 3 just confused why is performance so terrible, I personally don't believe it's the lack of ram but software related. I asked myself what is the last big feature that Google added to Android Pie?! Just maybe that is the culprit. Then, Digital Wellbeing came in to mind. So I went in to my settings clicked on Digital Wellbeing, clicked the 3 dots on the top right and turned off usage access. Disabling digital Wellbeing from tracking apps and data. After that, my phone has been butter smooth not one stutter or lag. Switching between apps is a breeze now, no more text input lag just speedy performance throughout the whole UI. Also, if you reduce animations in developer options it's a whole new experience (blazing fast). I highly recommend everyone who is experiencing performance issues (sluggishness, lag, stutters) throughout the UI to disable digital Wellbeing. Let us know if it fixed the performance issues and spread the word.

Best regards,

@Trueray17


Update: It's been a week and with the workaround performance has been exceptional.

GooglePixel,Almost no Spam Calls on Pixel 7,"Maybe I am in the minority here, but I swear after getting the P7 I went from getting multiple times per day spam calls and texts to basically none at all. I hear iPhone users complaining about spam all the time.  

I feel like this is an underappreciated feature. 

I've had the same number for 20+ years. 

Anyone else feel the same way?"
GooglePixel,"As a pixel user, I'm now afraid to buy new pixels in the future.","After messing around a little bit in the subreddit, especially in the past two months, I've seen A LOT of people complaining about having hardware issues, covered by warranty and never getting their phone back for ""free"", because of google ""scamming"" them and saying that they found more problems. Another thing that makes me worry a lot are all of the complaints about the support just being inexistent for some issues, but one of the most annoying thing is that I pay full price for half the feature (I'm italian and like many other European countries I didn't get the new assistant, car crash detecion, recorder transcript and stuff like that). I want my pixel 4 to last at least another 2-3 years, but then I don't really know if I should go with another pixel or not... I like everything about this phone, from the hardware to the software, but the ""shady"" things google is doing right now really make me think about stepping back from buying another pixel phone. I was wondering if maybe europe rules make the customer support act different? Please let me know what you think about that."
GooglePixel,I would like the option to send a fax machine noise when screening spam callers.,"So instead of 'Tell me more' or 'Remove me from this list', I would like the option to send a fax machine noise.

Not sure if it would work or not to get the number removed from the list but could be worth a shot."
GooglePixel,Just got the find of a lifetime today. Basically brand new pixel 5 for $113.,"So I'm a phone reseller. Recently had some great finds buying with the same company. I got a brand new Galaxy Note 9 for $129, brand new S10+ for $117, and a slightly used but mint condition pixel 5 for only $113.

I have NO idea why someone would put such a phone for such a low price. But all I care about is that it's in my hands and perfectly functional, not locked or blacklisted.

Edit: A lot of people are suggesting it was not paid off. Verizon was the original carrier, I just called them and they confirmed it was paid off. Please, stop suggesting I'm trying to scam people. I'm not."

GooglePixel,"""Driving Detected"" - I'm about to throw my Pixel 5 out of my truck window...","I use my phone on a vent mount/holder in my F150, connected via Bluetooth. I used to use the Android Auto app on my phone but Google killed that and now we have driving mode.

A couple months ago I turned on the setting to detect driving and ask if I want to enter driving mode, since the only other way is to use Google Assistant with no option for a shortcut. Since I enabled that, it began randomly popping up when I picked my phone up off my desk or take it out of my pocket, yet I can drive 100 km/h on the highway to work and it won't detect my driving until I'm pulling into my parking spot at the office, so I turned it off.

I have now turned that setting off 10 times, ~~it lasts for a day or two and then randomly turns back on~~ but if you back out of the settings page and go back in, it turns itself back on immediately."
GooglePixel,The Pixel 6 will have an in display fingerprint reader.,"The great Google biometric dilemma. I've heard glowing and not so glowing opinions of the fingerprint sensor on the back, power button is optimal position imo. My personal view is that in display fingerprint readers have inferior speed and are also a little awkward. 

I'm a firm believer in having some kind of intentional interaction before the phone unlocking, and all the implementations of in display readers I have seen unlock the phone immediately, accidental unlocks may be an issue. I've never used one however, do you folk think it's a good move?

I'm a Pixel 4 user and a sucker for motion sense, I know, crazy. I love the quick face unlock but maybe it's just what I'm used to."
GooglePixel,"Had to Call 911, It actually worked.","So I'm a dasher. And stupid stuff is pretty common when dashing. This is the first time I've had to call 911 tho. Before this, the last few times I'd tried it failed and wouldn't let me call out. The experience was cool actually. Once I dialed 911, the phone when it Emergency Mode, gave me my location, cross streets, allowed me to send information not over the voice if I wanted and notify my emergency contacts I have set up all in seconds. 

I know we've had issues on pixels in the past, I know I have. Just figured I'd post letting people know it worked at least once."
GooglePixel,"""Historical"" (10+ years) iOS user switching to Android (Pixel 4) - My experience","I hate the customised versions of Android most companies offer (Samsung, LG, One+, Motorola) and I was skeptical even with the real vanilla Android offered by Google. Being a UI/X designer myself, the visual part of the OS is extremely important to me. I particularly hated the fact that even pure Android had different shaped icons (unlike iOS, and unlike they do now...thankfully!), which in my opinion caused chaos and it was truly hideous in general. In general, the whole OS aesthetic looked incoherent and poorly polished, to me, compared to Apple's iOS. Luckily, Material Design arrived and Google started taking UI/X design seriously. i gave it 3-4 years to mature and last month i finally felt ready for the switch. Let me just specify the reason of my switch is how boring iOS is. A static OS, slow to evolve and add new, meaningful features. So yeah, I went on  and bough a Pixel 4. Holy cow...I'm freaking loving. The minimalism, coherence, playfulness, iconography, attention to details and visual design in general within the OS are great. Not to mention the huge variety of stock wallpapers offered by google...truly mind blowing. I have absolutely no doubt at all the Google Pixel will be my daily drivers for many years to come. Only downside...and it hurts to say that, apps are kinda better on iOS. Especially Instagram. I have no idea as to why, but i can definitely live with it. Google Pixel 4, love you buddy!

GooglePixel,Pixel and Pixel XL Customization Starter Guide,"I've done a few of these for other device subreddits and so far [each of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/426ivu/nexus_6p_customization_starter_guide/) has been [well received](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/4v1am7/oneplus_3_customization_starter_guide/). I know the Pixel/Nexus community generally has a handle on how to customize their own device, but I'm hoping this is useful for the beginners.

___________
**[Pixel & Pixel XL Customization Starter Guide](https://www.androidexplained.com/pixel-starter-guide/)**
______________

I write these tutorials in a way that (hopefully) anyone can understand. They're broken down into very basic, step by step instructions as I walk you through how to complete them from start to finish.

I've even started to record videos and I've been embedding them into each tutorial page for those who learn better by watching rather than reading.

Still, there are dozens of tutorials and it can be daunting for anyone who has just started learning how to customize Android devices. This is why I put together this starter guide(which was actually a request from the LG G3 subreddit that I was writing device tutorials for).

________________

This starter guide is a way for me to group up all the tips and tutorials that I have specifically written for the Pixel phones into 4 categories. The first is a basic category and these don't need to be done in a certain order. These are just things that are good to know about (and I also reference them in other tutorial articles).

The next two are for rooting the Pixel phones, and they need to be done in a certain order (which is why they're numbered). There are two here with the first also walking you through fully installing TWRP and the other method keeps TWRP read only so it is easier to accept OTA updates.

The last category contains software tips and tricks that are software based and already built into Android 7.x . I've come to understand that not everyone wants to dig through the settings menu to find hidden features so I write about them and so them off on video.

This way you can check out some of the features of the Pixel phones without needing to hunt for them and enable them for yourself.

______________

If a post like this is frowned upon, then I apologize, but I do think it adds value to the Android/Pixel community. I hope that it can be useful for some people within this subreddit that have never hacked into their phones but have always wanted to.

Let me know if you have any questions about these tutorials, if you have suggestions for future tutorials that I should write, or any other constructive criticism you may have :)"
GooglePixel,Re-register your fingers after Jan update,"P6 got Jan update a few days ago. While I didn't have ""bad experience"" like MKBHD did, fingerprint sensor was at best, passable. After the update, I didn't see any improvement. 

Then today, reading an article from Chromeunboxed, Robbie mentioned that he re-registered the fingerprints. So, I did. Wow, it's a big improvement. Not sure if this works win any ""fastest fp reader"" award but it's almost on par with my P3 physical sensor.

So, if you have not seen improvement, it's no harm re-registering.

Edit: u/k00lguys suggested not to remove all existing fingerprints or we'll have to re-enable apps that authenticate using fingerprints. I learned it the hard way."
GooglePixel,Jon Prosser: Pixel 4a (Black) delayed yet again to October 22; “Barely Blue” has been removed entirely.,
GooglePixel,Google did the right thing.,"In light of all the recent reports of the rear camera glass shattering without any physical damage, I was extremely nervous about contacting Google when it happened to one of the Pixel 7 Pro's I purchased. 

From what I gathered, getting a phone replacement without having to pay for repairs wasn't too common. Needless to say, my anxiety about the possibility of having to pay for something when not being at fault was very high. Here's how my experience went.

When I contacted customer service online regarding the issue, I requested a call back. Upon speaking to the rep, I made it very clear immediately that the camera glass breaking was not the result from a drop or physical impact of any kind. I was as polite as possible about it.

After speaking with the first customer service rep, I was told this would be covered under warranty, and they transferred me to a device support rep.  The device support rep asked me for the phone's IMEI number, (a serial number works as well) and a picture of the phone without a case on it. I provided both, and they escalated it and gave me a call back after about 20 minutes. 

They gave me two options: I could send in the damaged phone after being factory reset, and they would send me a new one, or I could request a new one with a temporary hold on a credit card with that hold being removed once they got the old phone.

I was very pleased with this outcome, and it tells me Google is very aware of this issue, and at least from my experience, they made it right without hesitation. I didn't have to argue about how the damage occurred, nor was I ever questioned about it. I have preferred care for both phones, and that was never brought up once while talking to either of the reps. With that being said, if this has happened to you, here is my advice:

When contacting Google about it, ask for a call back so you can speak to a person. Let them know right away that this didn't happen from a physical impact or drop.  Be very polite and courteous, as this can go a long way towards a positive resolution. 

I hope this helps."
GooglePixel,MKBHD says his Pixel 6 Pro has become more buggy since launch,
GooglePixel,Android 12 is already wearing on me,"The big ugly stupid fucking clock on the lock screen, the bizarre background stuff that has turned all my notifications pink even though I have a different background set, the obnoxious pull down that takes up the whole screen and adds button pushes to do stuff.

I want 11 back. I feel like 12 has really stepped away from technical and business users and taken a big leap toward iPhone users. It's so disappointing. For the first time in a long time I really am unhappy with the ""next version"" of android."
GooglePixel,I wouldn't believe anything about 'Pixel 5' out there quite yet.,
GooglePixel,"Support promised me an email response within 48 hours, then ignored me for 9 days, then had the fucking balls to send me a ""we hope we were able to fix your problem to your satisfaction"" email survey.","What the fuck is wrong with these people?? My camera hasn't worked for weeks, the same issue that's plaguing hundreds of Pixel 2 owners. Tech support went through the typical bullshit (clear cache, safe mode, factory reset) and when none of that worked, had me generate a bug report. I responded to the email with that bug report, and didn't hear from them for over a week. Now it seems they have closed my case without fixing it or responding in any meaningful way.

I'm so fucking sick of being jerked around by these assholes. They don't know how to fix anything and they just ignore you if their hardware or software is causing you any real problem. All they know how to do is recommend safe mode and a factory reset, or send you an outdated set of troubleshooting tips from a previous version of Android.

I've never been treated this badly in my life by a company I've given so much money to (well, besides my health insurance provider). This is fucking insane.

edit: Didn't expect this to get so much attention. My anger and profanity was immature and probably doesn't help the situation at all. My apologies if anyone feels personally attacked. I *love* the Pixel brand as a product and a community, but the support has been appalling."

GooglePixel,How I traded up to a Pixel 3 for free. Actually got some money back!,"So first off, you should know if you buy major electronics with your AMEX or CITI card, they will extend the manufacturer warranty by a year (two for Citi).

I bought my OG Pixel XL new around Feb 2017.  So the manufacturer warranty expired March 2018.  Amex warranty then started.  A few months back, my Quick Charge stopped working, and I noticed my Android Auto would disconnect often.  So I started the Amex Warranty process.  It's very simple!  They had me fill out a few forms, then take the phone to an authorized repair facility (ubreakifix).  They looked at the phone, said Google doesn't provide replacement mother boards for the USB C port, and they couldn't repair it.  Got that printed on a sheet and submitted to AMEX.  About a week and a half later, a credit showed up on my AMEX account for the original purchase price of $894! 

While this process was ongoing, I went ahead and ordered a Pixel 3 and selected the trade in option.  Amex didn't require me to send my OG Pixel anywhere!  So I paid for the new P3 with my AMEX.  My P3 came in about a week after my AMEX credit hit my account.  Perfect!

Just this past week, I received  emails stating my $50 credit from the P3 purchase promotion was in my account.  I also got an email stating Google received my OG P XL and would be crediting my AMEX $150.  

So there was an initial entry cost, but I basically was able to trade up for free, and receive $200 in credit.  I'll probably hold on to this phone for another few years and see if I can keep this train going.

Edit:  I also want to say I was surprised that I got the full $154 for my OG XL.  There was a very hard to see hairline fracture on the front, many scuffs and dings on the sides, and the back glass by the camera was smashed to shit, even whole flakes missing.  I sent it in, in my former wallet case.  Checked the ""Screen turns on and no cracks"" checkbox.  Got the ""full value""..."

With the amount of vertical integration Google has now there's no real reason that phones like the 7 series and Pixel Fold can't be supported for 5+ years, so I **really** hope that a big part of the next announcement day is a commitment to longer term support, if not for existing devices then *at least* going forward with new ones!"

Best customer support experience so far I think. I've had other experiences with very friendly and helpful people, but this was streamlined as well. Awesome. 10/10 Google. Thanks!"
GooglePixel,Me about everything 30 to 40 mins,
GooglePixel,I switched to the iPhone 12... and I switched back,"As you might find out in my post history I made a post asking if the Pixel 2XL to 5 is a sidegrade instead of an upgrade. I was contemplating switching to the iPhone 12 pro, and I eventually did.  I decided to make the switch as I no longer thought of myself as a power user (no rooting, minor sideloading, no customization). For a little bit more context, I own an iPad pro (2017) and I've been using macOS as well as windows devices for the last 10-12 years (both have their strengths but that's a different topic). I've never owned an iPhone before.

Is the iPhone 12 pro a good phone? Yes, it most certainly is. The hardware is great. The SOC just eats through everything you throw at it. The taptic engine is something google should introduce on the Pixel as it sparks little moments of joy. If you select a date with the scroll wheels it just feels like you're swiping through a real scroll wheel with little clicks. The glass sandwich with stainless steel sides feel like a premium device.

The software side of things is a breeze if it works.

**My experience**

Apple has changed, the Apple of Steve Jobs is dead. I think the reason why our tech got so good was because company's had to keep up with the great UX of the iPhones and iPads and the wonderful ecosystem Apple had created. Back in the days I used to look at iPhones of my friends with wonder while my own android based HTC was a hot mess of crashes and very bad software updates. The iPhone just worked, had high quality apps (I will never forget the pre material design apps on Android) and the camera was great.

Maybe my expectation were too high or maybe I just expected much from a €1159 euro phone but the experience was a let down. If the software works it works, if it doesn't work it's a search for loopholes as iOS doesn't want you to control anything. I knew the lack of control iOS gave the user from my long use of iPads but that is 'just' a tablet, not my main device.

*iCloud*

The syncing with iCloud is good, if it works. If it doesn't work it just doesn't work at all. My iCloud storage was full (partly my bad, partly why should my iPad backup huge PDF's without asking me?) but when I removed something from my iCloud storage my iPhone wouldn't detect that I removed the files. Eventually I had to reboot my phone to get it to see there was free storage. I wanted to make a backup of my photos and videos on iCloud. There is no way to force this unless you toggle the iCloud switch in settings. When I did I got the message my phone only keeps high quality pictures on my device and original in the cloud. I never said I wanted that but ok, Apple thinks this is the way. I couldn't turn off my iCloud until the original quality pictures were back on my phone (wait, I tried to turn it off to get it to sync to my iCloud as my pictures weren't in iCloud?). I decided to leave it be, they would auto upload to my iCloud when I put my phone on the charger and decided I no longer had interest in looking at the pictures and videos on a decent size screen.

*Pictures*

The pictures are good but they are oversaturated. My Pixel will capture the astounding browns of fall and was willing to let winter be winter with a grim grey sky and mute colors just as I perceived the scene. The iPhone just gave me a blue sky and oversaturated greens and blues, the pictures felt like spring instead of winter. If you're willing to edit pictures this is a great phone for you. I want a phone that captures the scene I'm enjoying. If I wanted to get pictures I needed to edit afterwards I would grab my mirrorless camera. Because of the bigger sensor the night mode is better on the iPhone 12 pro but the lens flare ruins the shots.

*Video*

Video is leaps and bounds ahead of my pixel 2XL. The Dolby Vision looks great (if you have the device that supports playback) and the stabilisation is really good for handheld usage. I think the 10-bit video is great but not that useful you're not into videography. The thing I really dislike is the lens flare when shooting in dawn and in the night. It ruins the footage and it's unacceptable for a phone of this price. Apple needs to fix this.

*The notifications*

Not too much to say about this, both the iOS and Android way work but it's different. Get used to it and both are good.

*The experience/OS's*

People that are saying that the UX of Apple is better haven't used Android in a good long while. Android has come a long way. The much touted animations of iOS are just as good on the Android side. The way the gestures work on iOS, Android has caught up with them. The only thing I need to give to iOS are the haptics, they are truly great but when I switched back I never missed them. Both OS's are mature and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Both OS's are great for set up and forget usage.

*The ecosystem*

This is not as good as expected, had some trouble connecting to my Apple TV and when the connecting doesn't work the error message aren't helpful (no error messages at all). Furthermore the ecosystem is crazy expensive. I was a click away from buying the Apple watch but when I was at the gate of the walled garden and looked back I saw a plethora of good enough android smartwatches at half the price. Everybody should decide this for their own but I just couldn't get myself to committing to an overpriced ecosystem when there's a lot of fun, cheaper third party android stuff around.

*The price*

I absolutely don't want to be the guy calling Apple phones, tablets and macs expensive (accessories are overpriced, I'll be the first one to agree) as I don't think they are. If you use most of them as long as you get support from them they are a great bang for buck. I use my iPads as long as they get support. The older macintoshes were a great bang for buck (the newer MacBook Pro's are not that great), the initial investment was a lot higher but they were great until the end.

*The hardware*

Definitely a win for iPhone. It's just feels premium in your hands. My biggest problem with the hardware is that the premium feel is masked by the cover you choose. The Glass sandwich feels very vulnerable mix in the high price and I couldn't use this without cover. Maybe you can but to each their own. I really enjoyed the hardware mute switch, it's wonderful. The click of when you switch it just feels great and you can do it without looking. I know Oneplus has this as well and I enjoyed the feature on my Oneplus One. This is something I would love to see on the Pixel lineup.

*'power users'*

I said I no longer think of myself as a power user and I'm not. The lack of control in iOS just made me long to get back to Android. I found myself to be the type of user who wants to do things his own way. I don't want Apple taking me by the hand and decide for me their way is the only way. They're opening this up but it's opening up very slowly. iOS is great if you expect a phone to tell you how to use it, in return you'll get a safe environment where it's difficult to do anything 'wrong'. If you're the type of user that wants control over how you use the phone Android is the way to go.

**My conclusion**

The iPhone isn't worth the cost of entry to me. It's a good phone but it's not that much better than my Pixel 2XL for day to day use. If I buy a €1159 phone I expect it to be flawless and it just isn't. I'm not a someone that uses a phone 5 years. I've used my Pixel 2XL for 3 years and it's the first phone where I would love to use it another year just to see what te Pixel 6 brings. My battery is acceptable and with my covid lockdown lifestyle it's sufficient. I've put in my order for the Pixel 5 a few days ago and I'm happy to be back in team Pixel.

If you're trying to decide to go for <insert iPhone model here> I think the most important conclusion is in the 'power user' paragraph.*""iOS is great if you expect a phone to tell you how to use it, in return you'll get a safe environment where it's difficult to do anything 'wrong'. If you're the type of user that wants control over how you use the phone Android is the way to go.""*

You'll get used to the rest of the stuff (the good and the bad) but this will sting you every day you use iOS. I want to add to this that you should also go for Android if you're an early adopter or just want the latest tech stuff.

**Am I breaking NDA?** Nopes, got it off the used phone market. NOT a member of Google's review free phone group.

**Proof I have the phone**
https://imgur.com/a/XrSz0iA

**Device Info HW Screenshots**
https://imgur.com/Rk29cdo

**Size** Smaller than Pixel 7, but slightly wide and taller than Pixel 6a. The 6a would still be the best one handed phone below $500 IMHO. Above $500 it would be Galaxy S23 (never had the Zenfone 9 to compare).

**Design** Same as Pixel 7, they did make the display flush with the frame like on Pixel 7. If you thought Pixel 7 had sharp edges then Pixel 7a also has them. ~~Plastic frame~~ Metal frame since 6a has metal frame, and plastic back since its not cold to touch on the frame like Pixel 7. Volume rockers and power button have moved down a bit when compared to Pixel 6a. 

**Hardware** Tensor g2, 8gb ldppr5 samsung ram, goodix finderprint, face unlock on deck, samsung display, stereo speakers. 

**Weight**
6.8oz or 193g
the pixel 7 comes out to 197g on the same scale
the pixel 6a with a screen protector comes to 187g

**Display** Same size as Pixel 6a, 90hz confirmed. UI is smooth as Pixel mostly are unless you switching from a 144hz phone and scroll through twitter like crazy in which case you will find it laggy. Colors are good, not S23 quality but good. Bezels are bigger as compared to Pixel 6a. Maybe because of frame wrap around display design.On Pixel 6a, display sits a bit above the frame. Not good for direct sunlight just like Pixel 7 & Pixel 6a. Pixel 6a screen protector will work on Pixel 7a, will be close but will line up.

**Battery** 4300mah per device info hw app. 18-20w wired charging per the usb metered cable I have. Wireless charging confirmed. No reverse wireless. 

**Biometrics**
Under display fingerprint scanner (NOT ultrasonic) is as fast or slow as Pixel 7. Does not unlock with unrecognized fingerprint (like it did on Pixel 6a at launch). Face Unlock on deck. 

**Sound & Haptics**
Stereo speakers are decent, and haptics are same as Pixel 6a. Not Pixel 7 or Galaxy S23 class.

**Software**
Running March 2023 security, and October 2022 Play System. No updates available, might be released on launch day. I dont see spatial audio option, but clear calling is present. 

**Camera** 

Gcam version is 8.8.225.

What can I say, its a Pixel. Pictures are Pixel quality. Main and wide angle pictures are both 16.1mp. Main is f/1.9 and wide angle is f/2.2. front is f/2.2, 12.2mp pictures. 

Front camera can do 4k, no option to switch between 30 and 60fps, so am assuming its 4k30 only. 

I dont see Action mode or cinematic mode as a camera option. Do see long exposure.

GooglePixel,I hate the Assistant Driving Mode,"What was Google thinking?
Its terrible there is really no excuse for this.
Please give us the Android Auto for Smartphone Screens App back.
I cant use maps in driving mode while not having a active route. I cant use Waze, Spotify somehow doesnt list my playlists or its either way to difficult to find while im driving. and the worst part in Germany you cant even trigger this mode manually, either its via Maps or the phone magically decides to ask you if youre driving and then you can enter this mode... what why?

Driving Mode is cluncky, glitchy and really unsafe to use.

She said to me, ""Why doesn't Apple have this stuff?""

GooglePixel,"FedEx did't deliver the package. Google said: Can't help, call the police.","I bought a Pixel 4 XL 128 GB on October 22 at Google Store with the expected delivery date on Oct 29. While checking FedEx tracking page, the delivery date was Oct 25, then by the end of the day, they changed to Oct 28. After that, the delivery date was changed to ""Pending"". I called FedEx and Google and both of them said they'd open an investigation. On Nov 1 FedEx updated tracking status to ""Delivered on Oct 28, signed by: signature not req."". However, this shipment required ""indirect signature"". FedEx told me by phone this was the driver's fault because he didn't get any signature but they can't do anything for me and I should contact Google. Finally, Google closed my case and here is the final answer.

Should I sue Google? FedEx? Both? I don't want to file a dispute with the credit card company because I know I will be blacklisted by them or by Google. I think police won't help much, specially because I think this package was never delivered. I don't know what to do. Any help?

# UPDATE 1:

I found a [very similar topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9sjz2s/fedex_lost_shipment_google_wont_send_me_a/) where Google reversed their decision thanks to Reddit. So guys please help me making Google see this post!

# UPDATE 2:

* A Pixel Community Manager from Google /u/PixelCommunity messaged me saying that they're investigating.
* I also submitted a Reddit request to /u/dmziggy. He emailed me back saying that they're looking into the issue.
* Then I received another response from my original request with google support and the same person that told me to contact the police for help told me they will check with ""other department"".

I don't understand what's so difficult. FedEx already admitted their fault but they said that only the shipper can initiate a claim because their contract is with google not me.

# UPDATE 3:

This is the proof of delivery I got from FedEx:  [https://prnt.sc/ptjn7j](https://prnt.sc/ptjn7j)  this would be funny, if it were not so sad.

# UPDATE 4:

As per Nov 10th, no one from Google Support has contacted me again. I've asked /u/PixelCommunity for updates in my case, no response.

# UPDATE 5 (REFUND ISSUED):

So today after more than 3 weeks or trouble they finally issued a refund for me.

GooglePixel,Why this channel is full of complaints?? Any happy pixel users?,"Everyday in this channel, I see tons and tons of complaints, how their pixel is acting weird, bootlooped or stopped working. Is it only me  whose pixel has been working flawlessly(bought it in january). Yea, I had couple of small issues, but that's normal, since my ipad on ios 13 is also not without issues. The only problem that I have is that spotify shuts down automatically three or four times a day in android 10. Other than that, it is smooth and works pretty good. 

I am also subscribed to iphone and Apple channels on reddit, and the complains are nowhere near this channel. I wonder why is that, is it because Pixels are full of issues or pixel users are generally more loud in comparison to iphone users. 

So, is it me or anyone else have their pixel 3, 2  or OG working perfectly?

GooglePixel,Pixel 7 Pro said to have 1500 Nits of Brightness,
GooglePixel,The auto brightness of this phone is driving me up the fucking wall,"I have had the Pixel 6 since 2 weeks after launch, so it's had plenty of time to learn my brightness habits. It's had plenty of time to adjust to my usual conditions. Even still, I have never had this much difficulty with having to correct the auto-brightness in a phone than the struggle I endure with the Pixel. 

I can be sitting in a stationary position, in an unchanging environment, light or dim and the auto brightness just can't figure out what to do. Without even moving the phone, the brightness will just drop. Or increase. And cause me to have to adjust it. It was fine a couple times but when I have to do it regularly, something is up. 

Never have I had to fight with an otherwise silly feature on a phone and something tells me if it hasn't figured out lighting conditions after this long, it probably never will.

/rant

Edit: I fixed it. Turned the damn thing off."
GooglePixel,Finally got my pixel 6 pro fingerprint sensor to be consistently faster,"I've put way too much time into finding a workaround for this problem that shouldn't have existed in the first place.  Below is the method that got the best result so far (less than one second unlocks 95% of the time).  This will not work for someone who needs to enroll more than two fingers.  

First, you enroll your primary finger in the exact position that you usually hold your phone, but apply the absolute lightest pressure you can to the screen that it will read. I'm talking feather light while following the very specific instructions on the screen.

Next, in the same position with the same finger perform another enrollment but this time with firm pressure.

Optionally,  you can use another finger to enroll the same way but you want to save at least 1 of the 5 allowed enrollments for later.

Now you wait until you're in a different place and experience a very bad read on your finger. That is where you stop (if safe) and use one of the remaining enrollments to enroll that specific scenario. This isn't perfect, but I found that I needed a version of my primary finger that was enrolled while in daylight, outside with the sun overhead.  You may need a copy when your finger is dry, cold, or all the above.  If you didn't enroll a second finger, you can use the remaining enrollments to help the phone learn more situations.

We shouldn't have to lick our fingers or type our password on this 2021 flagship phone.  I hope Google figures out a way to make this better, or enroll more copies of our prints, but for now this is the most reliable method for me."

The snow was really heavy and it was getting in my coat pockets, so I put my phone in my back jeans pocket under my long coat. 

My flatmate was taking videos of me skipping in the snow. About 2 minutes later I realised my phone was no longer in my back pocket. We retraced our steps, the snow was still fresh so we could see exactly where we walked and we carefully looked for the phone. We couldn't understand why it wasn't immediately jumping out at us. There was however a terribly suspicious man standing where we had been and we immediately jumped to conclusions, particularly because he was being ""overly helpful"". I had tried using ""find my phone"" but couldn't pinpoint close enough and the 5 minute ringing facility didn't seem to be working. After about 30 minutes of searching in the snow, I went home contacted my provider and blocked the phone and ordered a replacement SIM card. I decided to report it lost/stolen at the nearest police station, at which point I gave a description of the suspicious man. 

The next day, I was viewing the videos my flatmate took of me and just happened to zoom in. I managed to pin point the exact moment the phone fell out of my pocket. As convinced as I was it had been stolen, I have returned to the park every day for the last week to dig and find the phone. The snow had started melting yesterday, although still some ice, but I still hadn't found the phone so resigned myself to the fact that my initial suspicion was correct. 

This morning after heavy rain, and the snow completely gone, my partner secretly snuck out to the park. There, completely unscathed and still working, my Google Pixel 3XL. 

I still cannot believe it. 

Tomorrow, I need to return to the police station, tail between my legs and tell them how stupid I was and that man WAS really being helpful. 

At least my faith in humanity and technology has been somewhat restored during such a shitty time."
GooglePixel,4a wallpaper ported to all phones!,
GooglePixel,So it turns out borrowing a friends Sim Card Tray will void your warranty.,"So I'm a little bit annoyed.

My Sim Tray cracked at one end and eventually broke leaving my sim card stuck inside my phone. Using a pin I was able to remove the sim card and friend who had a spare Pixel 2 leant me his sim tray as I needed my phone urgently for work.

Contacted Google for an RMA as my phone still has a year left under warranty. I foolishly mentioned I'd been using my friends Sim Tray in the interim and they asked me to confirm this was the case. I said yes assuming this was part of the problem solving path, but they then informed me that in doing so I'd breached the terms of my warranty and am no longer covered for manufacturing defects which otherwise would have fixed my phone. I can buy a spare sim tray online no problem, but if anything else goes wrong with my phone in the next year..I'm toast.

I'm pretty annoyed, at myself for even mentioning my friends sim tray and also at them for being so stubborn. I paid around AU$1200 for the phone and instantly voided it's warranty by using an OEM part borrowed from a friend. 

They've always been fantastic in the past, but this may cause me to reconsider my relationship with google going ahead in the future."
GooglePixel,I put together simple AMOLED wallpapers that line the edges of the Pixel 2 XL,"[Here's a preview.](https://i.imgur.com/06Jin03.png)

I was inspired by wallpapers I've seen for the both the iPhone X and Galaxy Note 8. Thought they were pretty cool so I decided to go ahead and make a few for the Pixel 2 XL. I made one with Google colors and others using only one color.

Note: These wallpapers look best when your display calibration is set to saturated. Really makes the edges pop! Also, these were made to be used in immersive mode!

Hope you guys enjoy! :)

EDIT 1: I realize that for some, the border may be a bit too thick. I'll remedy that and release a slimmer version soon! Sit tight.

EDIT 2: Due to many requests, slim versions are now [live](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ED69NMoW0j6EE5eHuYLgglTdf_OAaOwz?usp=sharing)! The rounded edges are now much cleaner. The reduced border thickness makes it look good [on phones not running immersive mode](https://imgur.com/XmS9wlk) as well!

I have also been getting many requests as to how I got my home screen the way it is. Since a lot of people seem to be interested, I will be posting instructions on how to get it this way here.

**Launcher:** Nova Prime (If you don't have prime, [buy it now](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&hl=en)! It's on sale for 99c. Totally worth it!)

**Icons:** [Min - Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanmkelly.me.min&hl=en)

**Widgets:** [KWGT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.widget&hl=en) in conjunction with [Huk KWGT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hukkwgt.kustom.pack&hl=en).

1. After installing all the prerequisites, launch Nova Launcher and go into its settings. To do this long tap at an empty spot on your home screen and on the bottom left there should be settings.

***If you are already aware of how to load preset settings into Nova you can just restore my backup file by downloading it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SR5bIDbFYfO3jEfgSEdt4k98ze0pQMxM/view?usp=sharing).***

2. Tap look and feel > Icon theme and select ""Min""

3. (Optional) Disable the dock: Nova Settings > Dock > Enable (Off)

4. Set your home screen to allow more icons. Nova Settings > Desktop > Desktop Grid > Set it to 7 on the left and 6 on the bottom.

5. Next, you want to scale the icons up so they don't appear small. To do this go to Desktop > Icon Layout > Icon Size = 150%. Right under that, you can disable labels too if you want (which is what I did).

6. Next, you want to set up the widgets. To do this long tap on the home screen and add a KWGT widget. Choose 4x2 and resize it to match the size of my ""December"" widget. Once it's on the desktop, tap on it and choose the widget that I used. You'll need to find it amongst all the other widgets available. Once selected, there should be a ""layer"" tab that you can tap. Tap it. Set the scale to 220 (Or whatever size you prefer). Once that is done, tap the save icon on the top right and press home. The widget should appear on your desktop at the proper scale.

7. For my center widget and bottom, the process is the same as above. Find it and edit it's ""layer"" tab once more. This time I set the scale to 105. To change the avatar icon to a photo of your choice, go to the ""items"" tab. Profile Pic & Time > Profile pic > Load a photo of your choice. Once that is finished, once again hit save on the top right and go home.

8. Enjoy your newly themed home screen!

EDIT 5: You know what? It's 2 am right now but maybe there are other things that need to be done! Finally, the highly requested wallpapers for the OG Pixel XL! **Click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15R3ufr6269sygJbJbqjvZowF1xjJn-Wo?usp=sharing) to download them!** I figured since a lot of you have been waiting for them, I might as well have created them before going off to bed. With this, I hope I have satisfied all you Pixel users out there!

**Also, the wallpapers made for the Pixel 2 will work wonderfully with the OG Pixel.** This was pointed out to me by /u/filmgeekvt. Thanks for the heads up!

I will now be going to bed so I'll answer any messages or concerns in the morning. Still though, can't believe how this progressed! From a simple wallpaper idea into having to adapt it to multiple sizes and resolutions because of demand. And getting reddit gold too! (Thank you, kind stranger!!) Never expected that! Thank you guys for the kinds words and for your general interest in this! You're all awesome."
GooglePixel,Is Google ever going to add new wallpapers to the Pixel. Live Earth wallpapers are amazing but they are the same ones since I got the phone in November,
GooglePixel,Switching to Pixel was the best decision I've made.,"Hey,

I've come from a Note8 and before that I was an Apple user since iPhone 1. So, here it is...

**The Phone:**

I've never felt a phone *feel* as good as the Pixel in my hands. I'm an average sized man with dainty computer hands, as my wife puts it, and the phone fits. Its edges all merry to one another and the transitions are seamless. This makes the everyday pickup, use, hold, put away, fumble, twirl of my phone like no other. The construction of it feels really solid but it doesn't feel like some hard piece of hardware in my pocket. The overall size of the Pixel 3 is perfect for typing on one hand if needed and even reaching across the full screen when I'm one handing it in my offhand. 

Coming from the Note 8 I was a little worried about the screen but it's honestly the best screen I've looked at. Its gorgeous. Its bright. its colors aren't over saturated or over processed. It seems to reproduce visuals with sensitivity to the content you're viewing. The Note 8 over processed its colors and I had to go in and change many things to get it to feel right. Or just neutral and balanced. 

The buttons click with satisfaction. The fingerprint sensor is perfectly placed. its such a natural position. When I grab my phone I don't even realize that my finger is already right next to or over the sensor. Its so perfect. 

The speakers... I'm actually astonished at how well they reproduce clear sound without distortion that you normally hear from that annoying person on your commute home. They aren't overly bright and tinny, they feel right for their size. We're not talking crazy bass or anything like that but you won't be annoyed by them by any means when you're using your phone to listen to some tunes while you clean a room. They're fairly loud and that is also pretty cool. 

**The accessories:** 

I actually really enjoy the pixel buds. I know... call me crazy but the ability to adjust the size of the little hoops that keep the headphones in my ears is fantastic. They also sound really great. I mean, I have DT 770 pros and I do live audio mixing and so on and for headphones that you get as an accessory to your phone, they really have fantastic sound. They don't try to color your sound or change it to fake anything. They stay true to, as close to true, as the recording that you're listening to. They also don't' hurt the ear after extended use. I kind of forget they're in my ears. This is particularly nice on commutes and just cruising around. No, they are not going to noise cancel. They let in your atmosphere and I'm ok with this. I want to hear the world around me a bit so I can be aware of my surrounding. Bonus: they plug in via USB-C and integrate with Assistant. You can program your voice for assistant with the headphones specifically. Thats great! I wish more headphones did this. 

The rapid charger is crazy fast. The dongle for standard 1/8 headphone jack is a nice to have and the USB-USB-C adapter is always appreciated so I can plugin whatever I want into my pixel. 

**The OS:**

I thought iOS was good. Even superior to Android but I was so limited on how I wanted my phone to function. I switched and I felt free. So so free of the walls that Apple had built around me. Absolutely freeing. I don't even know how to explain it but I just felt happy. 

Android on a Note 8 is a bit bloated. So I had to do all I could to configure the device, which was great that I could, to make it more like stock Android with some awesome custom skins and all that but some of the Samsung stuff just kept popping up. I wish I could just remove it all but manufacturers are just not going to let you do that. Bummer. 

Stock Android is so crisp and clean. It's warm and homey. its the invitation I think all Apple users need to finally see how amazing this OS is. I love how everything is at your fingertips. I can move stuff around and make it mine. The Notifications are easily the best thing on Android, IMO. I can read, reply and see everything clearly. I know just by the icon what app is trying to get my attention. I love this. The way that the AOD utilizes simple icons to give you a glanceable overview of life is a thing of beauty. The simple readout of a notification or calendar invite is so easily digested that it doesn't derail you from whatever you were doing. 

The OS is made for you. Its made for you to feel like you're not trying to use an OS. It's not designed with the intent of making you do things a specific way and only that way. I love that. It's a relief to know I own what this software is going to feel like for me.

**Project Fi:**

I jumped boats and I couldn't be happier. The thought that my bill will never exceed X, no matter where I roam or how I use it is fantastic. The fact that it utilizes multiple networks to find the best signal is brilliant. I've had fantastic coverage everywhere and I don't even feel like I've had any blank spots. I mean... if you really wanted to I bet you could keep your phone bill down to like $25-$30 a month. Yup. I said it. It's totally possible. All depends on how you want to configure your lifestyle. Knowing that I'm paying for the MB's, yes MB's, I'm using vs just charging me for an extra GB is amazing. I shouldn't have to pay for what I don't use. If you're considering switching, ping and I think I have some sort of referral that hooks us both up. 

**TL:DR - Conclusion.**

Stop thinking about it. The Pixel 3 is the best daily driver for common use. If you're on the fence, jump over with open arms and run through a warm field of happy thoughts knowing you're joining a culture of free thinkers. An experience that isn't structured but designed to be made into your own experience. Rejoice! You'll be happy made the leap in more than one way. 

Got a question? Ping. Happy to answer. Cheers peeps!

GooglePixel,I have a Google Pixel 6 Pro - any questions?,"Edit 2: Thank you so much everybody! I tried to answer everything in this in my review, and I'll be going through and answering everyone whose questions weren't answered in the review.

Edit: Jesus christ I stepped out for a couple hours and came back to 300+ in my inbox! Thank you so much everyone for all the questions, I'll be reading through and getting back to people tomorrow, and also noting down everything so that we can have one of the most comprehensive reviews out there. It's thanks to all of you that I'll be able able to put together such a thorough review :)

Hey guys!

So I have a Google Pixel 6 Pro for review at XDA-Developers, and I wanted to reach out to the /r/GooglePixel community to see what questions you want answered. [I threw up some pictures on my Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamConwayIE/status/1450831285497253899) if you want to check them out, but I also wrote [that hands-on article](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-pro-first-impressions/) that's currently up on XDA too!

Just a disclaimer: I can't answer most of your questions yet, but I'm currently in the course of writing my review and I'll try to cover as many of your questions as possible throughout it. So feel free to comment below, and anything I can answer currently I will answer! 

In case you're wondering too, [I did this last year for the Google Pixel 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/j8kl72/i_have_a_google_pixel_5_any_questions/) here on /r/GooglePixel, and it greatly helped me write my review. I really appreciate getting a lot of questions as it helps me to help you, and as I've already mentioned, I'll try to answer anything I can now, too. 

I'll also answer everything once the embargo is lifted!"
GooglePixel,I love my Pixel 5,"I wanted to share my experience with my new Pixel 5. I see a lot of threads about all sorts of issues with this phone, but I think people are much more likely to be vocal when they're upset with a product. If a phone works like it's supposed to, people don't take to the internet to write about it. But I wanted to share my experience anyways to prove that issues are far from universal.

I bought my Pixel 5 after the battery on my 3XL really shit the bed (more on this in a minute). I've had it for about a week now, and I absolutely love it. Highlights:

**Build:** The phone feels fantastic to hold, especially without a case. For me, this is the perfect size. Everything is reachable, unlike the 3XL for me. I got the Sorta Sage model, and maybe it's just me, but this is one of the best looking phones I've ever laid eyes on. I adore it. The bioresin (plastic) coating feels good, not cheap, and not slippery. No fingerprints to be found.

**Display:** The 90Hz is fantastic. When I pick up my 3XL it feels like it's stuttering when I scroll. I'll never go back to 60Hz! If I REALLY pixel peep (as in, hold the phone 2 inches from my face) I can see that the Pixel 3XL has a slightly sharper display, since it has a better resolution. But the difference is only noticeable if I'm looking at hard edges of icons from extremely close distances. In any normal case, the display is great. Brighter than the 3XL too.

**Speed:** Who needs the best processor? I browse social media, chat, take photos, watch videos and play occasional games. Not once have I ever noticed this phone stutter or freeze. It is exactly what I need. If you told me it had a high end processor, I'd believe you. Unless you're a *hardcore* power user, this will more than do the job.

**Battery:** This is my favorite part about this phone. Granted, my 3XL battery was horrendous, but I love the battery on the 5. Just yesterday I unplugged my 3XL and my 5 at the same time (8am). I took my 5 on long 5 hour hike, taking lots of photos and 4k60 videos. When I got home, my Pixel 3XL had lost more battery from just sitting on the table. The battery like is a huge improvement! I have yet to end a day under 40%.

**Speakers:** The under display speaker gets a lot of hate for poor sound quality. When I compare to my Pixel 3XL, the 3XL wins, yes. But not once have I thought the audio was low quality. I regularly watch a lot of Youtube on my Pixel 5 and the audio has never been an issue.

In conclusion, I really enjoy this phone. The overall user experience is fantastic. It just works. Nobody asked for my review, but I just wanted to put some Pixel 5 positivity and appreciation out there. Very happy with my purchase."
GooglePixel,Pixel 2 to Pixel 5 = Fantastic phone!,"From Pixel 2 to Pixel 5 = Fantastic phone!

So much hate in this sub I thought I'd share my fanboy thoughts to help reverse the trend.  

I came from a Nexus One > Nexus S > Nexus 4 > Nexus 5 > Nexus 5X > iPhone 6s > Pixel 2 > Pixel 5. Been using the Pixel 5 for a little over a week.

Speakers - It sounds fantastic for music and podcasts. Better than my wife's iPhone XS. The XS sounds muted, heavy mids, hollow, while the P5 sounds fuller and with more detailed highs. Much more ""throaty"" than my P2. Okay technically it's not equal parts left and right channel, but for what it is, it's more than passable, especially in portrait. It performs like a component speaker where the bottom is your main driver and the top is a tweeter to fill out the highs. Yes the top speaker on its own sucks, like listening to just a tweeter without the main driver. I rarely make calls so that's fine to me (and your use case might be different and that's okay).

Processer - I don't game but take a lot of pictures. P5 is blazing fast for my needs. Sure there's a second longer picture processing time but that doesn't damper the experience. I take thousands of pics of my toddler and the camera keeps up with her running and jumping and dancing and craziness without skipping a beat.  

This thing is absolutely gorgeous with the thin, symmetrical bezels and lack of speaker grills in front to collect dust. It's the clean monolithic design I've always wanted. I personally would take this design over more powerful top speaker any day. And taking a half step down in processing power for a lower price point is exactly what I need from a phone. I don't want to pay $1000 for a phone.  

I didn't really like the phone in my first few days of use since it didn't immediately feel like much of an upgrade over my P2. I almost returned it. But with some more time I've grown to appreciate all that The P5 offers. The Pixel 5 still has the attention to detail of a top tier phone without the top tier price: the camera lenses are all centered perfectly with the cutouts in the front and back. The body lines where each piece connects are all straight and satisfying. The buttons are firm and clicky. The weight and feel in hand. The mirror finish on the G logo and power button. The centered and symmetrical placement of all the slots on the bottom. No complaints, this phone is fantastic! Bring on the downvotes."
GooglePixel,Siri in iOS 14 vs The New Google Assistant,
GooglePixel,"Anyone else having issues with ""OK Google"" only working on occasion?","It's been pretty faulty for me on my newish Pixel 3. Sometimes it's just delayed or muted for some reason and I don't realize it actually responded. Sometimes it responds but isn't actually listening to me, or only catches the last few words. Sometimes it just doesn't activate at all until I restart. When it works I love it, and it was reliable 80% of the time.

Now, however, it's not working at all, locked or unlocked. The squeeze works and so does just tapping the button. I tried resetting my voice profile and that didn't work. I restarted and then uninstalled Google app updates and reinstalled, set it all up again. Didn't work, so I restarted and that finally worked. A few hours later though and it's not responding again! Anyone else having issues or know another fix? "

GooglePixel,I had this video in my brand new Google Pixel 3 XL,
GooglePixel,"When my OG Pixel is ready to be retired, I may be abandoning the Pixel ship. Please allow me to share my perspective. Let's discuss.","I've been exclusively using Android and Google products since 2008, and I've really enjoyed the experience. Google has always felt like the forefront of powerful, configurable, and usable software, and with the introduction of the Pixel on Android 8, I genuinely felt content and loved the Android experience as seen through Google's eyes. The hardware felt right, amazing camera, smooth and user friendly software, and I could use the phone and software exactly as I saw fit.

However, things feel different now.

First, what is up with Android 9? I'm genuinely shocked at how many things have changed, and a lot of it seems like changes for changes sake; removal of WiFi/bluetooth quick settings menu, volume slider being changed, gestures are terrible, the recent apps screen feeling clunky, along with many other changes that seem like unnecessary feature cutting. I love software updates and generally look forward to them, but with Android 9, the direction feels off and the changes have no good replacements/solutions.

Also, how can essential apps be abandoned or neglected so often and so quickly? Hangouts being abandoned for the general user, messaging being a total mess, Inbox going away, and apps just generally being introduced and then abandoned without explanation or direct, better replacements. This concept of being introduced to software, just to be taken away some time in the future, is getting tiresome. I want to also point out Android Auto here, because it falls directly into this category of breaking often and being neglected, but I won't expand further because it's off topic.

Hardware. The headphone jack is a non-negotiable for me. I have expensive wired headphones that I use literally all day; so, I just can't listen and charge my phone at the same time anymore? That's it? Or I have to use terrible quality, spotty connection bluetooth now on new headphones? I have to rely on a dongle that is shoddy construction with high failure rates? Ok. If that's Google's answer for me now, their vision of mobile functionality does not align with me anymore. I guess I'll have to find hardware elsewhere.

The recent battery saver mishap. I'm surprised this isn't a bigger deal in the Android blogs and news sites. I'm okay with Google being able to push server side changes. Hell, I'm even okay with Google doing something like this as a test of a new feature (although less thrilled about it). But to have this happen, with absolutely no notification or announcement is craziness. I have the OS configured exactly how I want it, and if Google wants to change that configuration, at least let the user know that it happened. I missed important notifications due to this battery saver change, and to me, that's completely unacceptable. I simply cannot trust my phone anymore knowing that system settings will be changed without my knowledge. Again, if this is Google's vision moving forward with Android, I guess it's not for me.

Finally, I actually never saw this day coming. I guess I was naive, but after getting the OG Pixel, I really did think that I'd be sticking around the Pixel ecosystem for a looong time. With everything that has changed the last couple years, I just can't envision a path forward with the Pixel, and potentially even Android, anymore. That's really disappointing. I don't want to move on, but it's becoming increasingly clear that Google's vision of hardware and software just doesn't line up with what I feel like is a user friendly, stable, and interesting mobile experience anymore.

TLDR - I'm not finding myself aligning with Google's vision anymore. Please read the above though because I want other perspectives.

Edit -

Ummmmm, wow. I was not expecting this many responses. I just got a chance to really sit down and look at what others have said, and I have to say, I'm quite shocked at how many people are resonating with what I originally outlined. I honestly did not expect to bring these things up and uncover what seems to be an underlying and growing frustration within the Pixel community. Maybe I've been out of the loop, or maybe I've been avoiding the inevitable disappointment, but I really am sad to see I'm not alone here.

I know it won't happen, but I'd love to hear the perspective of a Google Community Director or someone about this. My intent with the post revolves around trying to understand how and why things got this way within the Pixel/Android ecosystem. Part of me is still grasping to the point that all of this may still be salvageable, if I just had visibility into the overall direction and reasoning behind the evolution; but I'm not hopeful I'll get that chance. If Android devs or community liaisons see this, please don't be afraid to address the community. A lot of us are here with genuine intent (and a love for Android) and are willing to listen with respectful and constructive insight.

Finally, I probably won't get the chance to respond to most of the replies, but I will be spending the evening reading through everyone's comments. This post wasn't just to complain or vent, and I'm curious to see what others have to say. I've been a member of other open source communities thoughout my life, and I'm totally willing to change my perspective and expectations if I'm presented with reasonable and fair rebuttals; hell, I welcome the opportunity to be convinced differently than where I'm at now. Depending on my availability, I may even try to compile a list of the common threads, including both positive and negative opinions."
GooglePixel,"Reports: Google, LG, don’t want Qualcomm’s super-expensive Snapdragon 865",
GooglePixel,The best thing about switching from iPhone to Pixel...,"I've had my Pixel 2 XL for over a year now and only JUST realised one of the best things about it: I've never thought about storage in the time I've owned this phone. The Pixels' free unlimited photo storage combined with the smart freeing up space is so good that I've just forgotten storage is even a thing. Just wanted to remind any other pixel owners that some of the best features are the ones you don't notice.

Conversely on all of my previous iPhones, I would constantly get intrusive pop ups telling me I'd run out of storage, or run out of iCloud (with no helpful option of 'clear iCloud storage', just 'buy more'). I had less tech-savvy friends who would just pay for more iCloud without even knowing what was on it, because they didn't know how else to get rid of the constant pop ups.

Anyway, have a great day."
GooglePixel,"As someone that works with their hands a lot, the Pixel 7 fingerprint sensor is useless","The tiniest little knick on your thumb and it doesn't work. The littlest bit of dirt and grime and it doesn't work. The smallest change in how sweaty your hands are and it doesn't work. Google got rid of external fingerprint readers (which companies perfected over the course of years) just to use a much inferior in-screen sensor as a marketing gimmick.

Honestly, I actually really like this phone. But I'm aggravated that I have to give up something my budget-conscious pixel 4a did exceptionally well... I assume one day that in-screen sensors will be great, but I'm at a loss of what their advantage over external sensors is."
GooglePixel,Does anyone prefer the 3a because of its plastic build?,I personally like the plastic build because of how much I tend to drop the phone.  Just yesterday I was in Walmart and I wasn't paying attention so my phone went flying before it crashed into the floor.  Surprising it survived with no damage.  Oh no case or screen protector.  I also like the plastic build because it's much more comfortable to hold.
GooglePixel,21 days of no Customer Service!,"****Update****
24 days total but only 3 days after posting here on Reddit and filling out a Reddit request and sharing on FB and Twitter, and sharing the post with the Google customer service representative, I have been issued a refund for the phone. They couldn't send me a replacement device because they did not currently have any in stock, and instead of dragging this out longer I chose the refund. I thank everyone one who shared their experiences and tried to help, and for the people who said its useless posting stuff like this here are wrong, It clearly helps draw attention to common issues a company has but do not admit they are common issues. It also gives people another avenue to pursue when their current options have stalled. I wont be 100% satisfied until I see the money back in my account which could take up to 10 business days. But once again Thanks!


I ordered a Pixel 3 XL for my wife's birthday, it arrived after an erroneous shipping delay and on a day that wasn't scheduled by FedEx ground, We signed for the package opened it up and there was no phone inside. Upon closer examination of the package you could see where it was cut open with a box cutter and re-taped. I immediately contacted Google and was told they would get back to me the next business day with the steps I would need to do to resolve the matter.  A few minutes later I received an email from Google support saying that there was nothing they could do and they fulfilled their part of of the transaction and they recommend I contact local law enforcement. Ofcourse I called back because this was not true they had not fulfilled their part of the transaction because I did not have a device in my package meaning it was taken by FedEx or someone at the Google fulfillment center (something that could have maybe been prevented by security tape which all major companies and carriers use instead of clear box tape like Google uses). Anyways after I called back I was issued a Case ID took pictures of the packaging , digitally signed a declaration that the package was empty and was told there would be an investigation. After 3 days I follow up because they said it usually takes about 3 days, no update, I follow up at 7 days no updates,  10 days no update. I call back an on the phone over an hour no update , they tell me they can't issue a replacement or refund until there is an update, I ask why it is taking so long no answer, today is 21 days since I reported this incident, no resolution in sight, I'm extremely dissatisfied customer service is non-existent, have several Google products and may just trade it all in over this. This post is a last ditch hope of some kind of customer service since I see some people have luck after posting."
GooglePixel,Fuck the pixel 5 gap. I'm in love,"I'm writing this with 47% at 9 am, when it was at 100% at 8am yesterday. INsane. Plus I put it in a case so the gap isn't an issue. It's snappy, the screen is awesome, the size is perfect, and the fucking amazing battery life. Loving this phone. No regrets"
GooglePixel,Android P: I miss the drop down options under BT and wifi,"So when I drag down the navigation bar, in android 8.1 (and previous) I could select my bt connection and wifi connection without going into the settings. This is missing in android P and I miss it!"
GooglePixel,"Talk about devaluation. Google is willing to give me only $190 for the Pixel 6 Pro, it was $900 less than a year ago 😩","I love my Pixel, but it sucks how quick Google is to drop the value of their own phones. They were offering $550 during Black Friday, not sure why it dropped so much in two weeks."
GooglePixel,Switched from Pixel 2XL to iPhone 12...tried hard but couldn't like it swapped out for Pixel 5 and couldn't be happier.,"Switched from Pixel 2XL to iPhone 12 why because all the online reviews/ influencers sold it hard to me...tried hard because of camera but couldn't like it swapped out for Pixel 5 and couldn't be happier.

Honestly after spending 4 days with IOS and iPhone 12 I can't fathom how someone can prefer this to pure Android on the Pixel unless they don't know better... everything felt slow and sluggish, slow scrolling, animations, notifications were horrible...no other way to say it really hated the software experience even the screen sucked( so yellow) only good thing was beautiful hardware and great camera last time I tried to switch was iPhone 6 and this was same experience as then was expecting iOS would have been leaps and bounds  better based on glowing reviews."
GooglePixel,What's the most annoying thing about owning a Pixel vs. an iPhone?,"For me... It's the fact that Pixel owners are so limited in cool phone cases.  I know this is ridiculous, but I hate going to websites for phone cases and they only make them for iPhones. Or how when I search, the Pixel is listed under ""Other Phones"". This ANNOYS me!  Probably more so because I'm a woman and I don't always want a black, clear or drab color of case. I always have to settle for questionable ones from Amazon that don't always have the best protection. Other than this, I've loved my Google Phone since Google Nexus days."
GooglePixel,Hi there! I'm just newbie to Android community and using my new pixel just couple of months. Today I've noticed one interesting thing on my live earth wallpapers.

GooglePixel,Pixel 5 Review: The Google Phone Grows Up - YouTube,
GooglePixel,The Pixel 3a has reshaped how I look at smart phones.,"I've been an Android power user since day one. Always buying the top of the line phone every two years. I didn't hesitate paying $950 for my Note 8. I full on intended to buy the Note 10, even with the likely huge price tag. 

Unfortunately I just recently cracked my Note 8's screen and back glass. So instead of paying $200-300 to get it fixed, I bought a 3a yesterday and will sell my Note for parts. I'm in love with this thing for all the reasons everyone been talking about. 

Now, I cringe thinking about buying a ~$1000 phone when this $400 one is SO good! It just feels irresponsible to pay so much more money for not that much more functionallity. I really hope Google continues this line of killer budget phones.

PS: My S-pen will be sorely missed. I used that thing every day."

GooglePixel,Google are using a low quality OLED panel on the regular Pixel 6,"So I have seen quite a lot of posts from pixel 6 owners noting that they have a green tint and/or rainbow effect on white backgrounds. I myself had issues with the display on three different pixel 6's that I bought.

Just recently XDA released an article analysing the 6 and 6 pro displays and they confirmed the suspicions of many of us: Google are using a low quality oled panel (more specifically a rigid oled panel) on the regular 6 which is prone to bad viewing angles and tinting. In fact this panel is worse than the one on the pixel 5. 

https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-pro-display-review/

The author notes that this quality of panel really isn't acceptable at the $599 price and should have been priced $100 lower. The 6 pro on the other hand is using a top quality flexible oled LTPO that has great viewing angles and uniformity.

So for those are you having issues with your pixel 6 display it's really a case of whether you can put up with it or not, because these defects are simply inherent to the panel that is being used."

So I was happy when I read the first rumours about a Pixel Mini / Ultra. I was all the sadder when these rumours turned out to be false and the new P7a is almost as big as my current P6. 
Why do all new phones have to be so big? I don't get it..."
GooglePixel,Visual guide to P6 Pro Zoom Levels,"Whenever I have a camera with a couple different lenses I slap together something like this to help me visualize mentally what lens is right for the image I want to take. This is a composition of four different images, one taken at each preset zoom level, layered on top of each other. There's some minor distortion but generally they all line up pretty well.

Today's example. 

What am I doing wrong here? 9/10 times I use this thing it misses the mark. I've had it where I set the reminder, keep using the phone for hours, and then hours later the notification pops up.

GooglePixel,Google needs physical stores!,"I've been thinking briefly about this idea, if Google had at least ONLY one physical store per big cities, I truly believe that all that bad reputation with Pixels coming from RMA would be mostly gone.

Think about it, you have a problem with the device, you'll be just left to take a rendez-vous and having them checking the issue in person. No stress.

Once you're getting a refurbished device, you will be straight in front of it to look if anything is wrong with it, if it's the case, again, the workers are right in front of it too, they cannot skip it or being afraid of being f*cked by a customer that has rocked his device without a case for 9 months and have just realised that this can cause scratches and want a new now (for example).

I live in Montreal, and I'm dead serious when I say that if I absolutely had to do an RMA, I'd gladly drive 2 hours to Ottawa or Quebec City and get it done once and for all like in an Apple Store and BASTA then waiting for one to be shipped.

I think it's the missing piece for Google.

But Good Luck With That.

What are you guys thinking?"
GooglePixel,This is the best one ive gotten so far.,https://imgur.com/a/ELdw3HZ
GooglePixel,"We need to bring back custom vibration patterns for notifications, or at least more presets.","Years ago this was a capability and was removed in, what, like maybe Oreo? I can't recall. But given the onslaught of notifications and ways we use our phones these days, i find it absurd that Google hasn't come up with at least a minor range of standard vibration patterns available by default. Or at least the basic ability to create a few custom options. This is such a basic capability.

I don't even believe there are third party apps that do this (without root) anymore, since Google pulled the API as noted above, but i could be wrong/outdated. Plus that's not the point. Regardless, this is such basic, core functionality that i simply cannot fathom why Google hasn't improved it as they suggested they'd be doing when puking the custom notifications API (paraphrasing) years ago. I hung on forever as a Textra user just to hold on to custom vibrate tones until it was totally killed (worked for me for a year past the API being killed)

I hate a lot about iOS, but vibrate tones/patterns is an area it excels, despite basically everything else about iOS notifications being laughably inferior to Android. 

What do you all think? Am I the only one? I just want to know my SO had texted me based on pattern without having to grab my phone and check each time notifications that come in throughout the day, and this was always such a simple way to accomplish that. Thanks for listening...

E: to acknowledge that Buzzkill is a 3rd party app that can apparently do this today, and appears to be a fully local app (no internet permissions included or requested). Doesn't change my point but felt fair to include this. Thanks to u/Bryan967."

GooglePixel,I miss the finger print reader on the rear of the pixel 2xl and how you could do the whole swipe down with it.,I used it so much. Even now that I have a 6 pro and I have had 4 xl since it the one thing I have missed the most. Even if they just had that feature back I would be happier. I damaged the screen a few days before the release of the 4xl and could still use the phone just by using that.

GooglePixel,Google will fix Pixel 6 Pro ‘display residual light’ flickering issue with December update,

GooglePixel,"[Exclusive] New Google Pixel 6 renders reveal dual cameras, flat display, and more",
GooglePixel,Sent Pixel 3 to be repaired; offered refurbished device for $450,"My Pixel 3's battery died. I was unable to charge it or turn it on, so I sent it in through Google's repair program. I put down battery life issues because I'm 90% sure it just needs a new battery. 

They charged my card $80. I assumed they were just going to install a new battery and send it back. Instead, I get a message stating ""Take action by December 5th."" I check it. They ""inspected"" my phone and found it had ""battery life issues,"" the one I listed, as well as ""charging port damage,"" and a ""power problem."" So they offered me a replacement for $465.00 + tax. 

The phone had no charging port issues. I never had a problem with it and only wirelessly charged it. On top of that, I don't even know what a ""power problem"" is. I just wanted a new battery.

What really ticks me off is that a refurbished Pixel 3 costs around $180-$250 everywhere else on the internet. I bought it new for a little over $500 from Verizon. Like I said, I was already charged $80. If I take their offer, I'll be paying more than what I paid new in total. I'm through with this. 

I loved my Pixel 3. Even after it died a week out of warranty I was willing to pay to put a new battery in it. I'm sorry Google, but I'm not paying $500 to get a ""fully refurbished"" 2-year-old phone. 

TL;DR: Wanted battery replaced, got charged $80, and offered a $465 refurbished Pixel 3 instead.

Update: Got Galaxy S20, love it! Google says i wasn't charged, hoping it was a temporary hold. Waiting for bricked pixel 3 to be returned."

GooglePixel,Google Must Act Quickly To Avoid Another Pixel Bud Disaster,
GooglePixel,"Received two defective refurbishes, this one has stolen blacklisted IMEI directly from google, no one cares can't get help","Started having problems with my pixel 3 months after buying. Had to wait a while to return due to living in rural Utah without possibility of g giving up a phone access. Finally did it, and they sent me a fried motherboard refurb. Broken out of the box. I was forwarded to special customer agent, who emailed me a few times then ignored me for a week. Finally they sent me the labels to send it back again. Now, 2.5 weeks later I receive a stolen/blacklisted IMEI refurb. My verizon account get's locked for trying to activate a stolen phone. Rep on the phone tries to tell me that google goes through a rigorous screening blablabla, but a simple google search confirms that this IMEI is blacklisted. No one at google seems to care. I missed work opportunities becuase my line was frozen this morning at a time when I am out of work. Best they could tel me is try to send it back again and hope for a better refurb next time. How many times am I going to do this? I refuse to trust a refurbished phone from google at this point. Even if it makes it 14 days after that I'm left out to dry if any serious problems reveal themselves. They give me a phone that works for two weeks and they are totally off the hook even though it's junk? I don't think so at this point it's clear their refurbished are not to be trusted. I really need them to send me another phone asap, a brand new one that won't have these major issues. They said a specialist will get back to me in 3-5 business days. Seriously? Finally I contacted them again today and they said a rep will get back to me within an hour, still waiting. Is there no one at google I can go to who would actually care? The problems I sent the phone back for are the same problems I was having when I first bought it, if I knew waiting to return it would get me a refurb I definitely would have done it then, I guess that's on me. But I also never would have guessed that a certified refurbished phone could be stolen, have a fried motherboard etc.  I'm sure this is a criminal issue on the part of google if it was looked into. Recasing old phones with fatal flaws and calling's them refurbished....how could they not know? Didn't they get sued for this a while back with the older pixels?

UPDATE: Spoke with ""supervisor"" LJ  #34212

did not seem to care at all but did say ""I am the last person you will speak to about this"" Told me there are no quality control departments that will want to hear about this, there is no one else who he can forward this case to. Offered to replace with another refurb by the same method, mail in wait etc. Is adamant that 

""as far as google is concerned this phone is not reported stolen""

And I asked him ""what do I do if I just keep getting these trashed phones?""  he said I will have to just keep sending them back. And I'm like ""are we really just going to keep doing this?"" he said he guesses so"
GooglePixel,Google Pixel 4a rumored to come in only one size,
GooglePixel,Tensor: Details of Google Pixel 6 series-bound custom silicon potentially revealed in new leak,
GooglePixel,Google's Vision of Android is Still the Best!,"EDIT: Just to be clear, this is only MY opinion fellas

Last October, I decided to trade in my Pixel 4 for a Galaxy S20 FE thinking that it would be a faster more enjoyable phone, and also I had battery issues with the 4. Sure the phone felt quick and snappy at the beginning but after a couple months, the phone was feeling very sluggish. I think the culprit of this is actually OneUI's heavy focus on ""extra features"" on top of Android. Bottom line is I wasn't happy.

I decided to look around and found a refurbished Pixel 4XL on Swappa for $239. At that price I thought it was a steal, so I proceeded to buy it. After two weeks of usage, I'm glad to say it's good to be back. I loaded the Android 12 Beta 1 and the phone just as snappy as I remember!

It's not all about the spec sheet fellas!"
GooglePixel,To everyone who pre-ordered the Pixel 4...,"Call me petty, but this was my first time pre-ordering the Pixel 4 (previously I've only used iPhones). I wasn't aware of the Black Friday deal and I don't know, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way that the phone was $200 cheaper a month and a couple of days later after I bought it.

Anyway, I called Google, explained to them that it was cheaper and they gave me a $100 gift card to the Google Store. Everyone who pre-ordered received a $100 promo gift card, so this is Google's way of giving us our $200 off.

When I called I didn't have to fuss or argue with anyone, simply stated that it was cheaper and they took care of me.

GooglePixel,Number 1 best seller,I just realized the Pixel 3a is the number 1 best selling unlocked phone on Amazon. I hope this continues for people to enjoy the Pixel experience and know more about the pixel brand. #Teampixel😀
GooglePixel,Ambient EQ is a killer Pixel 4 feature and no one is highlighting it,"Ambient EQ is by far my fav pixel 4 XL feature and no reviewer is discussing it. I think it's incredible what a flat and paper-like effect it gives the screen and makes text super easy to read. And, almost no other Android phone has this feature (save for the LG G8 thinq afaik). I'm jealous that apple has had their similar True Tone displays for much longer. I now want all of my devices to have this. But why is no one talking about it? Seems like a huge differentiating factor that adds a ton of value imo"
GooglePixel,Google would have to give the Pixel 1 Android updates until 2021 just to match Apple and the iPhone 5s.,The iPhone 5s was released in 2013 and just got iOS 12 this fall which means it's been updated for the last 5 years now and could continue being supported a 6th year because Apple has not officially killed it. Meanwhile Google would need to keep updating the pixel 1 until 2021 just to match that.
GooglePixel,Unpopular Opinion: The Soli Radar and Face Unlock on the 4XL was amazing. (And I want it back on the Pixel 7),"I see a lot of hate in articles and forums about the Soli Radar on the 4XL but it was actually one of my favorite features of my 4.  I never used the motion based song skipping or navigation because I thought it was a gimmick BUT the phones ability to silence the ringer or the alarm when you go to reach for it was awesome and definitely felt like the future. Additionally it allowed the phone to spin up the face unlock feature  which gave you almost instantaneous unlocking of the phone surpassing apples face unlock by a mile at the time. (Usually my phone would be unlocked by the time I had picked it up and was ready to use it, unless a mask got in the way) 


I knew the 5 was a budget phone so when the Soli Radar was not included I was not surprised. I was however very surprised and a bit unhappy to see it had been excluded again in the P6P. I am really hoping they bring it back for the P7P."

GooglePixel,December 2021 Update Paused - Pixel 6,
GooglePixel,Google Camera 7.0 leaks from the Google Pixel 4 - Here's what's new,
GooglePixel,Here's a really quick & easy camera trick for interesting / dramatic wide angle shots,"This is what it looks like - https://photos.app.goo.gl/gL1JVvHB9SYctp41A

This is how to achieve it -

1) activate the front facing camera

2) the person taking the photo holds the phone with the top edge of the phone touching the ground, so that the camera lens is only a few millimetres from the floor

3) the person taking the photo stands behind the phone with the  screen facing the subject. The person taking the photo bends down to look at the screen to check the composition, but ensuring that they aren't in frame

4) once the shot is lined up, shoot a few snaps

Variation - instead of having someone else take the photo, lay the phone on the floor with a jacket or something underneath so you can easily adjust the angle. Put the camera in timer mode (3 sec delay), fire the shutter and get everyone in to position for an unusual selfie (this is how we did the Ferris wheel photo.

This is why its such a useful technique -

1) the front camera is a much wider angle than the rear camera, so you can fit a lot more into the field of view (great for big buildings etc in the background)


2) placing the top of the phone parallel with the ground ensures that you always get level photos


3) facing the camera screen at the subject allows them to position themselves better (like you can when taking a selfie)


4) having the camera low on the floor can produce dramatic results and is an unusual perspective that's hard to do in the traditional way (unless you lie on the floor, but who wants to do that?!). 


Here's why you probably shouldn't use it all the time -

1) the angle is sometimes unflattering - tends to work better if the subject is further away

2) mix it up - this is just another tool in your arsenal - don't over-do it!


Hope this helps / inspires!

Edit - thanks for all the nice comments and feedback :) I added a photo of my gfs 4 year old cousin to the album. I think this technique works well on animals and kids because it's generally better to take shots from their perspective (or close to)."
GooglePixel,Use Chromecast in Hotels via Hotspot without using your Mobile Data,"I was delighted to discover a feature of the Pixel that solves the problem travelers have when trying to use streaming devices like Chromecast on hotel TV's....many hotels set up their wifi such that Chromecast doesn't see the phone.

The solution to this is to set up your own WiFi hotspot and drive the Chromecast from it. This works fine but all the internet guidance on this tells you that this will eat your mobile data allowance fast. Well it might on lesser phones, but not on the Pixel series if the hotel wifi works. Pixel (versions 3 onwards) will feed the hotspot from the wifi connection so it acts as a wifi repeater. (No third party apps are required to do this).

Using the Hotspot makes it easy to use Chromecast with same settings in any hotel room. Get the phone onto the hotel wifi, turn on your hotspot, set up the Chromecast to the hotspot, and cast away. Turn off mobile data to confirm it's running via wifi. When the Chromecast is set up to work off your own hotspot it will work right out the suitcase in next hotel with no reconfiguration needed."
GooglePixel,"Google Camera hints the Pixel 6 XL could have a 5X ""ultra tele"" camera",
GooglePixel,From the Pixel 3 to the 5 - a couple of things,"1) The 5 is almost EXACTLY the same dimensions as the 3. 

2) Without a case it's kind hard to tell where the fingerprint sensor is because everything's the same texture, but thankfully muscle memory is a thing.

3) I was very curious what the texture felt like and I cannot believe no one has said this before IT FEELS LIKE PAPER. Paper-textured plastic. I quite like it. 

4) The USB-C port is smaller and allows for a tighter fit, which is nice.

Mostly I just needed to share that it feels like paper."
GooglePixel,I made a (crappy) video to prove that the Pixel Imprint page can be used to quickly learn your fingerprint profile.,"So, [in this thread's comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dnthw3/p4_can_you_really_only_register_1_face/f5gcph8/), I had a discussion about how there is no need to create multiple profiles for the same finger, and that the phone will learn and improve the same profile as reads your finger multiple times. u/eminem30982 insists that there are no reliable sources out there to say that the ""Pixel Imprint"" page can in fact, be used to learn your fingerprint. Yet he refused to test it himself to see if it works or not for him.

So, in order to prove a point, and to stop people out there giving advice to create multiple profiles in order to improve accuracy, I created [this crap quality video](https://youtu.be/XO0Zscps8tM)

Let me just start by saying I'm no cameraman, and I had to record this on my tablet, as I had to film myself using the Pixel 2.

A short explanation on my methodology. I wanted to prove that it is possible to expand my finger profile all the way to the first bend of my finger, despite only using my fingertips when initially creating the profile. 

In order for the phone to not register parts of my finger, I used masking tape to cover the bottom half of my finger when initiating the new profile. After that, I covered the top half of my finger and while and used the exposed bottom half to test that my finger wasn’t recognised.

I removed the tape, then I proceeded to repeatedly tap the sensor while moving my finger up and down so the phone can learn the bottom half of my finger. When that was done, I covered the top half of my finger again and used the bottom half to test, which my print was recognised successfully.

After that, I removed the tape, locked my phone (using the power button) then proceeded to unlock my phone, first with the tip, then again with the bottom part near the bend. A reminder that I only used the tip of my finger when I first created the profile.

Sorry about the bad video quality, hope this helps people out there with fingerprint accuracy problems.

Edit: I realised I should've tried to unlock the phone first straight after profile creation while having the tape covering the top half of my finger, in order to better show that the bottom half of my finger wasn't recognised."

GooglePixel,Clean your USB-C port!,"I cleaned mine today after dealing with a loose connection for a couple of months.  I had figured that something became loose inside the port because it didn't look dirty.  Boy was I wrong:

[https://i.redd.it/79iesas532521.jpg](https://i.redd.it/79iesas532521.jpg) (Swiss Army toothpick and Fi sim for scale)

This is probably less than half of what came out, most of the crud fell to the floor.  The dust/dirt really gets compressed in there and just when I thought I was done, I'd pull up another big ball of crud.  I've only had the phone since April.  

The toothpick from a small Swiss Army knife was the perfect tool for this.  It's plastic, thin, and flexible enough to go around the ends.  I've read elsewhere that a can of compressed air is helpful too, but as compressed/compacted as my dust was, I'm not sure that would have helped.

GooglePixel,Pixel Update Pledge,"[OnePlus has announced](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23484102/oneplus-android-updates-2023-phones-extends-support-period-select-models) that it's matching Samsung's update policy of 4 OS updates & 5 years of security patches for devices released in 2023 and onwards. Why isn't Google able to offer the same to its first party Pixel devices, especially now that its reliance on Qualcomm has ended?"
GooglePixel,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,"Ok Google, you made this one right.

After purchasing the iPhone 14 Pro Max, I found myself feeling disappointed and unimpressed. The iOS platform seemed stagnant and uninteresting to me, and Apple's reputation as a ""great"" software company fell short.

As I researched and watched more reviews of the Google Pixel 7 pro, I was impressed by the advancements in technology and design since the Pixel line. It was so tempting that I made the switch to the Pixel 7 pro one week ago and what can I say beside : I am absolutely blown away by its features, the AI-powered features, sleek user interface, and seamless integration with Google's apps and services. The screen is top-notch, the camera is just gorgeous, and the ecosystem is fantastic. I'am completely in love with this phone and can't imagine going back. 

THIS phone is why Android is now far away from it's competitor. It's just too good. Thanks Google for creating such an impressive device."
GooglePixel,Pixel prevented me from calling 911,"I had to call an ambulance for the grandmother on Friday as she appeared to be having a stroke. I got off a phone call with my mom, and proceeded to dial 911 just by typing and calling on my pixel. My phone got stuck immediately after one ring and I was unable to do anything other than click through apps with an emergency phone call running in the background. This is all while the phone informed me that it had sent my location to emergency services. Sadly I couldn't tell the person on the other end what apartment I was in, or what the actual emergency was as I was unable to speak to a human.

As my phone had clearly just been working from a phone call perspective, my best guess is the extra step of trying to send my location caused it to freeze. It then prevented me from hanging up and trying to call any phone number again. Luckily my grandmother is of the generation that still has a land line, otherwise I would have had to restart my phone, wait for a reboot, and then attempt to call emergency services so they could get people over asap. I'll let you know from experience that the last thing you want to go wrong during an actual emergency is your phone to mess up. Especially when time is of the essence, and the faster you get emergency services to your door, the more likely it is that you will survive.

I'm hoping that someone from Google can let me know that you're solving for this problem. Cause let's be real, as someone without a landline, I sure as hell don't want a phone that freaks out when I try to call 911 in the middle of a life threatening emergency. I'm supposed to trust that a phone will do the main thing is built for, and place the call, and let me speak to the human on the other end.

-----UPDATE-----
Tried calling again to see if the bug persists, and it does. I filmed it with my partners phone, and am happy to share. Going on 5 minutes and no response from emergency vehicles and no evidence that 911 was called from a phone log perspective. Checked my Verizon phone log and can see all other calls from today and Friday, but no evidence Verizon knew I was trying to call 911.

This is blowing up - wanted to clarify that I had been able get through on other calls the whole time and the 911 call was the only one that hasn't worked or been recorded on either my phone call log or my Verizon call log. I also contacted Google already, but haven't heard back. Also shout-out to whoever pointed me to the FCC as I'm filing the too. 

Google Support reached out to me through here - Thanks for the upvotes and the visibility ❤️ I've sent over a debugging report after replicating the issue. Hopefully their teams can figure out the issue.

-----------my response to how Google handled this--------

Hey! I wanted to give Google some time after posting their response in this thread and separately on Reddit before posting the below but at this point no one from Google has reached out to me to let me know 1) that there was a bug confirmed and it wasn't just my phone, or 2) how to fix it. Thank goodness Reddit peeps tagged me in things to make sure I was aware that there was a response and a fix for it. You would think with a bug this big Google would have at least responded in our email thread we have going to inform me how to fix it. Actually I would have expected Google to go out of their way and send a push to all Android devices with teams installed to inform their consumers of the possible issue.

You know it's amazing how a phone can bring feelings of safety, and how shockingly unsafe one feels when they know their phone is royally effed. The world is a tad bit scary when you're a woman alone walking your dog at night after a day in the hospital. Especially when you're a woman walking their dog alone at night who can hear gun shots a few streets down and is acutely aware of her  inability to call 911 for help. Be it for her own safety or for someone else's. 

People shouldn't have to wait for this story to make headlines to find out they need to resolve an issue of this magnitude, especially not the person who brought the bug to your attention in the first place. You have the ability to push a notification that informs us our software is out of date, which means you have the ability (and in my opinion the responsibility) to inform us that our life line to emergency services is potentially flawed due to a gap in YOUR software. This issue is bigger than bad press or your bottom line and you should be acting accordingly. 

I guess I shouldn't presume that the tag line ""do no evil"" means you inherently ""do good"" cause apparently you just don't ""do"" anything at all when it matters. Consider my lesson learnt.

----------------------- Other people ------------------------
Several other people have messaged me about running into the same issue, including one person today - a few days after Google acknowledged the issue, and a day after Microsoft acknowledged the issue. As this is a known issue actively impacting people after both parties took partial responsibility and both acknowledged the issue, does it make sense to reach out to a lawyer?

GooglePixel,MKBHD: “My Pixel 6 Pro has slowly gotten so buggy since launch in October that I can no longer recommend it at $900. Combined with the latest botched update it's just been a bad experience. My SIM is back in an S21 Ultra til the next review.”,

GooglePixel,Project Soli: What was promised vs What was delivered,
GooglePixel,This community needs a reality check,"The RAM management issues on the Pixel 3 are quite serious, and many people are having issues. Someone here had their navigation randomly switched off, and many bloggers / tech journalists have pointed out that apps randomly shut down due to this issue. It may be battery optimization or RAM optimization or whatever. The point is, I do not care what the excuse is and neither should anybody else. The problem is, that part of this community is so far up Google's arse that some urgent issues get down voted into an oblivion.

If you are paying so much money for a device, the damn thing should JUST WORK! I am a huge Google fan boy, but their incoherent and ridiculous strategy of pricing like iPhone but giving totally mediocre after care is really starting to piss me off, and it should piss all of you off as well. As fanboys, it is okay to say that Pixels take the best photos. It is okay to say you get pure android. But it is NOT okay to accept mediocre. It is NOT okay to pay upward of USD 1000 for a device and be Google's beta tester.

I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage during one of the iPhone events more than 7 years ago, and getting huge applause when he said - 'It just works'. Unfortunately we cannot say that about any of Googles mobile offerings. Messaging is an incoherent mess more than a few years after iMessage, the Nexus 5x turned out to be a sham, and Pixel is slowly headed there with the completely brain dead decision to put a hideous notch, and now this lack of software optimization. Heck, my current $200 Huawei Honor 6x (which many of you may not even have heard of) with 4 GB RAM and a Snapdragon 625 SoC handles multitasking like a champ, so there is absolutely no excuse for a device that costs 5 times more (and possibly has 5 times better benchmarks) to get basic things wrong.

TL;DR - stop mindlessly defending Google

Edit: this post has garnered way more attention than I expected. The fact that it has been reported several times literally proves the point I am trying to make. In any case, there have been a few productive discussions, and I think everyone can agree on the following:

- Let's report problems to Google via the feedback option on phones. There a separate thread. Not sure if linking is allowed.
- some people have had no problems, and that is great. Hopefully there will be fewer problems going ahead.
- let's be nicer to people facing issues rather than down voting because we do not agree that the issue is significant enough. 
- work arounds are nice. Fixes and patches by Google are better. "
GooglePixel,My brother lost his Pixel 4 while skiing yesterday. Today he found it under 20cm of snow.,
GooglePixel,I sent my phone to google in August to get replaced and have had the worst customer service experience of my life since.,"Im August my Google Pixel 1 stopped working. It would not turn on past the startup screen so I contacted google and they offered to replace it. I sent it to google returns in Grapevine, TX using the return label they sent me, and according to the tracking number it was delivered on August 24th. I was told it would take 7-14 days to replace it. But after 3 weeks I had not received my phone or heard anything from google. I tried contacting them and was told that they never received it even though the tracking number says it was received and signed for.  They said I would receive any updates as they come, but to no surprise there has not been a single update.  I have tried getting this problem solved through support chat, calling, and the pixel forum but nothing has helped make any progress in getting my phone. It seems like they must have lost it to me, but it’s been upwards of 3 months and I’d really just like to have my old phone back. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

GooglePixel,I just discovered this cool Google Pixel 4 easteregg using Google Lens.,
GooglePixel,FYI: Buying a Pixel has an Arbitration Agreement,"I'm not sure if people are aware of this since I didn't really see anyone else mention this but it seems that as a condition of buying a Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL you agree to a binding arbitration agreement (you agree to waive your right to a class action lawsuit and instead say that you'll use arbitration to settle disputes) if you purchase and do not return your Pixel within 30 days of activation if you do not opt out of said agreement. This kind of rubbed me the wrong way even though I know it's now just becoming standard to include these agreements in the terms of service for many things.

You can opt out of the agreement pretty easily, however, by using g.co/pixel/optout. Make sure that you do it in the 30 days though. Just letting people know in case they weren't aware. I'm loving my Pixel 3 XL otherwise.

Edit: Here are the pictures of said agreement: http://imgur.com/a/SA4ovsi

Edit 2: Someone else mentioned that the agreement is also in the set up process.

Edit 3: If you're not in the US this agreement probably doesn't apply to you.

Tl;dr: you give up your right to sue if you don't return your Pixel in 30 days **or** opt out at g.co/pixel/optout"
GooglePixel,Thought y’all’d appreciate this,
GooglePixel,I finally figured out why my alarm kept turning off...,"For the past few months, I could not figure out why on random days, with seemingly no reason, sometimes my alarm would either not go off, or turn itself off very quickly. Maybe once every other week or so, I would wake up 30 minutes later on my backup alarm, with no indication as to why the first shut itself off.

Well this morning, I woke up about 5 minutes before my alarm went off, and I have cracked the code.

The alarm is set to play a Spotify playlist, and one of the songs on that playlist is ""Where is My Mind"" by the Pixies. If you know the first line of that song, you may know where I'm going with this...

The first line in the song is ""Ooohhh STOP"", with the word ""stop"" said very clearly. My Pixel has been hearing that ""stop"" and turning the alarm off. Since it's a playlist on shuffle, it only comes up every once in a while, so it's not happening every morning. 

Glad that feature works..."

*I understand your concern. As promised we have checked with our specialist team. As per the update, the device is not eligible for a warranty and there is nothing we can do about it.* 

*I would request you to get in touch with our authorized repair partners UbreakiFix/Asurion and Google Mail-in. They may be able to help you with your issue for an additional fee.""*

I am not sure how Google is able to get away with this, but I am talking with an attorney to see what my options are for getting my money back.  I have a $500 paper weight sitting on my desk.

**Updates:**

I wanted to provide a couple of updates based on some of the comments.

* The phone was not purchased by Google, but through mint mobile.  Mint is pawning the issue to Google, as they state that their warranty is straight from the manufacture.  Their RMA page did not work, and this is the response I got from them when reaching out to the support:[https://imgur.com/lCnqZJT](https://imgur.com/lCnqZJT)
* Regardless, Google should honor the warranty when bought through a third party reseller, as stated clearly on their website:[https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer](https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer)[https://imgur.com/1JZKlrL](https://imgur.com/1JZKlrL)
* Some have suggested that I go into a uBreakFix and have them deal with it.  I tried that already, they sent me away saying I need a warranty claim number from Google for them to work on it.
* No the phone was NOT damaged
* Even if the warranty was not valid for some reason, Google should at least give an explanation for why, not jus this BS answer of ""its not eligible, because its not eligible""
* Because no modern day human can go without a cellphone, I had to go buy a new phone in the meantime.  I went with a OnePlus and have been very pleased with it, for far less money than the Google Pixel.  So at this point a replacement would be nothing but a waste of my life, as I would have to sell it to get my money back.  The hours of my life that are lost are a separate issue, which also has me bitter over this entire experience.
* To those accusing me of lying about talking to Google on the phone, there IS an option for them to call you when chatting with support.  Check your facts before making accusations:[https://imgur.com/Q2jvTh2](https://imgur.com/Q2jvTh2)

**Final Update 12/14/2022:**

Thanks to the help of u/dmziggy I finally got a replacement from Google.  However I am still stuck because I had to buy a new phone in the meantime, so its still a loss for me.  I am going to sell the phone, but I won't get back what I paid.  Because of this, I will be leaving this post up as a mar on Google's reputation which is well deserved. "

GooglePixel,"Paid $1000, received an empty box","So my Pixel 4 XL was delivered yesterday. Well, the box and all of the accessories were, anyway. Apparently the wonderful people at FedEx decided that they needed my Pixel more than I did. The tape on the bottom of the brown box was cut and replaced, and the white ""Pixel"" box inside had had its tape slit as well. All that was inside of that box were the charger and adapter. 

Google's customer service was wonderful though, and a replacement will arrive at my house on Monday or Tuesday.

GooglePixel,It Is New Phone Day - Don't Forget To Transfer Google Authenticator Before Wiping Your Phone!!!,"I forgot a while back on another upgrade, and it was a pain in the a$$ to get access to some of my accounts.  Unless someone has another trick to back up, you need to scan the QR code from your old device."
GooglePixel,"FedEx lost shipment, google won't send me a replacement","FedEx says they delivered my phone but the camera at my house show that they never showed up. While on the phone with FedEx they said it was delivered to a house three blocks away. They were unable to recover the phone after 48 hours and now consider the package ""lost"". It's been a week since FedEx admits they lost the package. The law requires that Google give me either a refund or a new shipping date but they have done neither although I call them every day ([https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0221-billed-merchandise-you-never-received](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0221-billed-merchandise-you-never-received)).

Last time FedEx delivered something to the wrong address (with a $1,000 Sony television) I just stopped payment on my credit card because after two weeks I got fed up with being the intermediary between Sony and FedEx. However, I have learned (and Google confirmed) that if I stop VISA payment I will get blacklisted by Google an all my services will get stopped. I use and pay for many Google services so this would not be good - now I'm reconsidering being so vendor-locked and might start divesting myself from Google after 14 years.

What are my options?

Google, if you see this, WTF!?

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this post to get so much attention, I was really just venting! Some people asked why I didn't use chat so a paper trail would exist so I tried it out for today's attempt: [chat session](https://imgur.com/nvXmZhP). I think the chat is pretty representative of the phone calls I've had. In the chat he asks for me to reply to the email I got from the support team. However, that email thread is nearly all me trying to get updates without a response.

&#x200B;

Update: Google has [responded](https://imgur.com/ScwoF4x) claiming that the order \*was\* delivered (see below). FedEx is now sending me a ""letter of explanation"" proving that they lost the package and that I did not receive it. I have no idea what Google has been doing for the last 7 days or why they couldn't call FedEx and simply ask them if the package was lost or not. Seriously, WTF google!?

`Thanks for contacting us about your order. We’ve carefully reviewed your case and our records confirm that your order was successfully delivered to the address you provided.`

`If the address you provided as the shipping address belongs to a company or a non-residential location, please contact them to track down your package.`

`Unfortunately, we’re unable to replace your order as Google has fulfilled our services by successfully delivering your complete order to the location you provided.` 

`As a next step, you may consider initiating an investigation with the carrier or notify local law enforcement. We’ll be happy to assist in an investigation.`

&#x200B;

Update 2: I spoke with an extremely unhelpful FedEx ""customer advocate"" who was unwilling to state ""yes or no"" if FedEx had lost the package when I asked for a simple written statement and indicated that I should open a claim. After 20 minutes of arguing I ended the call and confirmed that a claim had already been opened last week when I reported the package missing. I called back and a very helpful FedEx employee took over my case and said the computer did indicate that they had lost the package and that she would send all the paperwork they had to me - but it would take 5 to 7 days. I've also sent a reply to Google stating that FedEx admits they lost the package. Am I taking crazy pills? She also mentioned that because the pre-tax value ($999) was under $1000 they didn't need a signature. Also, she said that since Google did not report a value they would only be entitled to $100 from FedEx for the lost shipment.

&#x200B;

Update 3: A community manager from Google has messaged me and now I guess they are looking in to the matter internally. I also gave /u/dmziggy my information, I'm not sure how much someone who doesn't work at google can help but it's worth a shot. At this point FedEx has admitted fault but says that only the shipper can initiate a claim. On the other hand Google is claiming that since the package was delivered it is up to me and local law enforcement to deal with the problem. From my side the disconnect appears to be between Google and FedEx and I don't really understand where my role is in this ridiculous debate.

&#x200B;

Update 4 - REPLACEMENT BEING SHIPPED: A new person has replied to the support email and Google has reversed their decision and will replace the phone with 2nd day air shipping. I'm not sure if the community manager had anything to do with it but I'm assuming this Reddit attention helped push it through - so thanks to everyone who made my post popular. I hope Google learns from my experience so it doesn't happen to anyone else. I still don't know what went on behind the scenes between Google and FedEx but they need to get on the same page when it comes to deliveries. And require a signature by default!"

GooglePixel,Google Permanently banned my account because their system didn't recognize that I returned my phones to them,"NOT RESOLVED: 

Update March 15, 2018: [They re-banned my account](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/84sysx/update_google_permanently_banned_my_account/)


So, I've been on the phone with them all day but they won't budge. 

Basically, I returned my RMAs to Google and they charged my account anyway. I contacted them directly a few times, but they were not processing the return on time (14 days). I had to issue a chargeback/dispute with my card to prevent paying interest and late fees by not paying. 

A few days later, I get an email from Google saying I broke their terms of service and my account has been permanently banned. I've spoken on the phone to the returns dept and they confirmed that they did indeed receive the phones and that they don't see any fraud or issues on the account. One guy even admitted they've been having issues with returns not processing correctly, however, when they send the issue to an account specialist, they come come back and tell me my account will stay banned, forever. They don't give a reason, simply repeating that the terms of service were broken.

I've had this email since almost the days of Gmail beta and been a customer for years. I'm pretty upset I won't be able to use it anymore to make purchases. What's worse is they won't even let me speak to an account specialist who decides these cases directly. 

Edit: To clarify, Google Payments is suspended. App purchases, music, video, gift card balances, buying cloud storage, Youtube Red, Android pay, buying hardware from Google Play. I have a gift card balance that is stuck and I can't use/transfer it. I still have my email, photos etc (thankfully)

Update March 1, 2018: Google unlocked my account after this post got some attention, but is still fighting my credit card dispute. I've sent them and my credit card company tracking and RMA numbers but they are still fighting it. It's such a large company; since this issue has gone to dispute, I doubt different departments speak to each other.

It's been a pretty messed up day on that front...I don't want to say anything more about it at the moment as I don't know how this is going to go. 

Thank you all for the support.

As seen here https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-live-images-exclusive

I decided to contact Android Central to release the images because I figured they would have the most reach. I've been a longtime follower of Android Central and wanted to give them the exclusive. I spoke with the editor-in-chief yesterday morning and they released the article later that day. Now that the bulk of the info is out there I thought I'd open up the floor to some questions...soo here we go!

To answer a few questions right off the bat:

* My buddy is the one that found the watch. He is a bartender at the restaurant it was left at. They held it for a few weeks expecting the people that left it to return, but that never happened. He gave it to me because I'm the tech nerd so he let me deal with it.

* The reason the bands aren't attached in any photos is simple - my buddy forgot to give them to me with the watch. They were packaged separately and he forgot to bring them over, so he sent me pictures of them for the article (notice the background is different). I'll get them from him at some point and post an image of the whole package.

* No charger was left, and the battery is dead. The image with the 'G' boot logo was taken by my buddy the day he found it. It had a small amount of charge at that point but only booted to that screen, guessing there isn't a full OS loaded.

* No, I don't work for Google or any subsidiaries, and nobody is paying me to do this.

GooglePixel,60 features in Android 13 that Pixel users should know about,"Hi /r/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.

Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. 

Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!

Without further ado, here's my list:

1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to ""make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves."" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.

2. [**Resolution switching**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds ""screen resolution"" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)

3. [**Hub mode**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).

4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the ""Colors"" screen saver.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)

5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.

6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.

7. [**Virtualization support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https://blog.esper.io/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 

8. [**exFAT support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https://blog.esper.io/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849/)

9. [**Ambient Context events**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https://9to5google.com/2022/05/26/pixel-android-snore-detection/) about Google adding ""built-in"" snoring/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.

10. [**Cross-device calling**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.

11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).

12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. ""styles."" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https://blog.esper.io/android-12l-deep-dive/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)

13. [**Themed Icons**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the ""themed icons"" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).

14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can/will tweak this, though. [Before](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).

15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 

16. [**Photo Picker**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)

17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)

18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https://blog.esper.io/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)

19. [**Redesigned media player**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.

20. [**New media controls UI**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.

21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new ""active app"" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the ""active app"" list. [Screenshot of the ""active app"" button in the notifications panel.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the ""active app"" list.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)

22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to ""battery saver"" or ""performance"", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)

23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 

24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 

25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https://blog.esper.io/android-12l-deep-dive/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.

26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)

27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable ""control from locked device"" in settings. [Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).

28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The ""Privacy dashboard"" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of ""show 7 days"" option in privacy dashboard.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)

29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.

30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1524484117550796802) 

31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control/) [Demo + sample app.](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1557802529567694848)

32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)

33. [**""Vibrant"" theme is now actually vibrant**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).

34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https://blog.esper.io/android-12l-deep-dive/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)

35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called ""stylus handwriting"". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1555960332970967040)

36. [**File managers can no longer access /Android/data and /Android/obb**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the /Android/obb or /Android/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https://blog.esper.io/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https://blog.esper.io/how-scoped-storage-works/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.

37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis/) [Screenshot of the ""Restricted Setting"" dialog](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)

38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)

39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https://blog.esper.io/how-scoped-storage-works/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.

40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.

41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)

42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new ""follow typing"" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)

43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.

44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.

45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new ""turn screen on"" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https://i0.wp.com/blog.esper.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)

46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.

47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.

48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.

49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VOBIuEkWNSA/XR0jIcKZXTI/AAAAAAAAJi0/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.

50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by ""Bunsetsu"", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.

51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.

52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directi"
GooglePixel,Who else goes to tap on the home screen weather icon and gets the calendar instead.,There must be only be 1 pixel between the weather and date icons and it's getting infuriating opening the calendar 3 times before tapping just right to bring up the weather.
GooglePixel,My Google Trade-in Nightmare,"Chalk me up as another sucker for Google's trade-in program. I should have known better. I’ve read all the horror stories people have had. I guess I just hoped it had been up and running long enough that the issues would be worked out by now. Plus it just seemed much easier than trying to sell it on my own. Huge mistake.

Here are the detailed logs of my interactions with Google over the last six(!) weeks of trying to get this resolved.

* **3/18/18** – I purchased a Pixel 2 XL 64GB and initiated a trade-in for my old Pixel XL 32GB. The offer stated that I would receive a refund of **$288.00** to my Synchrony account as long as it powered on, had no cracks in the screen, and had been factory reset. The phone was in mint condition. I had never used it without a case or screen protector and it was literally flawless. Looking back, I should have sold the phone on Swappa. I’m sure I would have gotten a bit more money out of it. I just got caught up in the (supposed) ease of trading it in.
* **3/26/18** – I received the trade-in kit and recorded video of me performing a factory reset, powering off the phone, and sealing it in the box. I made sure to show the phone from all angles to make it clear that there was nothing wrong with it. Then I dropped it off at the post office.
* **3/30/18** – The phone arrived at its destination in Atlanta.
* **4/6/18** – I received a partial refund of **$165.60** with a note claiming “phone doesn’t turn on/off”. I called in to dispute it, spoke with a rep named Zander who assured me it would be resolved shortly. He asked me to submit my video of the phone working and was told I would be updated within 24-48 hours. I emailed him the video while still on the phone with him and he told me he received it. I was assigned case number: **4-5739000021983**.
* **4/10/18** – I emailed Zander back asking for a status update and received no reply.
* **4/13/18** – I emailed Zander again, still no reply.
* **4/17/18** – I contacted Google via web chat and was told the case was still being investigated and that I should hear back from them soon.
* **4/27/18** – I contacted them via web chat again with the same response- it was still being investigated.
* **5/3/18** – I called in to check on the status and spoke with a rep named Christy. She said she would personally help me get this resolved and that she would re-escalate the case to an account specialist since no progress had taken place. She said she would stay in contact and that I would hear back in 3-5 days. I was assigned a new case number: **6-9336000022109**.
* **5/7/18** – Christy emailed me to say that they were still looking into it and that she would keep me updated.
* **5/12/18** – Christy emailed me again to say the same thing, it was still being worked on with no progress.
* **5/18/18** – Christy called me and said the investigation had been concluded. She wouldn’t give me any details about it but said the best they could do is give me a **$50** Google Store credit. I told her I didn’t think that was acceptable as I was supposed to receive an additional refund of **$122.40**, not a credit towards a future purchase. At this point I'll never buy something from them again so the credit is worthless. She put me on hold and came back offering me additional **$30** credit. I didn’t accept that as it still wasn’t what I had been promised and I don’t want to settle. I purchased the phone on the premise that I would receive the full **$288.00** as a refund. She then hung up on me!
* I called back in and was transferred to the Order Management team. I was placed on hold multiple times for 45 minutes without accomplishing anything. This rep seemed really interested in the fact that I had video evidence of the old phone working and he finally offered to let me speak with a supervisor. He claimed the supervisor wasn’t immediately available though and that he would call me back later that day. I never received a call back.
* **5/21/18** – I called in and was transferred to the Order Management Team. I spoke with a rep named Will who said that the case is still open and he promised me he would have a supervisor call me back that day. I told him I just wanted to speak with a supervisor immediately since I didn’t receive a call back last time but he said it wasn’t an option. I reluctantly agreed to wait for a call back. Surprise- I never received a call.

I’m appalled at how horrible Google’s customer service is. I’ve bought several devices from them over the past eight years including a Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, Galaxy Nexus, all the way back to my Nexus One. I hate to say it but this is will be last purchase I make from them. I’ve been nothing by loyal to them and I’m blown away that they continue to treat their customers like this. It’s clear that they just don’t care. They’re too big and individual customers clearly don’t matter to them.

So here I am at a complete loss as to what to do. I feel like my only option is to turn to the community for help. Maybe posting it here will help bring my issue to light and get it resolved. u/PixelCommunity are you out there? Anyone from Google Support? I just want you guys to make this right.

**UPDATE 5/22/18**: Thank you everyone for upvoting this and helping it to gain traction. I never expected this kind of support, but I really appreciate this empathy I've received from this community. It worked! I just received an email from Google Support from a rep named **Jules**. She was extremely apologetic about this situation and has gone ahead to issue the remaining refund. I'm honestly stunned at the moment. It's hard to believe that six long weeks of pushing this have finally paid off. Thank you thank you thank you, to the r/GooglePixel community and to Jules. You guys have made my day!

**UPDATE 5/23/18**: I've also been contacted by a Google employee named Jason who has been awesome. He's gone above and beyond to make sure I'm happy and taken care of. Google, if you're listening, **Jules** and **Jason** are fantastic. They deserve all the credit for resolving this and delivering excellent customer service. Please use them as examples for the rest of your teams. They know how to treat customers and deserve to be praised for their efforts. Thanks again!

**UPDATE 6/15/18:** I never expected to be posting an update like this, but I feel I wouldn't be doing Google justice if I didn't. **Jason** and another employee named **Kyle** put together a care package for me. It was completely unnecessary but incredibly kind of them. They sent me a[ few goodies](https://imgur.com/a/xcbgaAJ), including a Google Home Mini, a fabric case for my P2XL, and pair of Pixel Buds! I'm at a loss. They completely turned this crummy situation into something fantastic. Thank you guys so much!"

GooglePixel,Just reordered the exact same case after one and a half years of use. Look at that coloration.,
GooglePixel,I really miss the little things that Android 12 completely got rid of,"Being able to tap the date to pull up the calendar on the clock widget was something I'd do basically every day, now you have to either assign a completely separate widget for your calendar or go into your apps to open your calendar. Also to show the weather in ""at a glance"" will also show the date even though the date is part of my preferred clock widget, so I have the date displayed twice on my home screen. It sounds small but it's one of those things that feels like a huge step backwards in this new UI. Hopefully Google will clean this up in future updates."
GooglePixel,Introducing the Pixel 4a,"Hi everyone,

We're excited to announce the newest additions to #teampixel: meet the Pixel 4a.

***Pixel 4a FAQs***

**Where can I order the device?**

Pixel 4a is now available for pre-order in the US on the [Google Store](https://store.google.com/category/phones) and on [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com/about/phones/). It will be available to customers on August 20 through the Google Store, Best Buy, Amazon, and more, as well as US Carriers including Google Fi, US Cellular and Verizon.

For availability in other countries, please visit the Google Store for more details: [https://goo.gle/32YLz7B](https://goo.gle/32YLz7B)

**How much does it cost?**

All details on pricing in selected markets can be found at the [Google Store](https://store.google.com/)

**Pixel 4a battery**

Pixel 4a has a 3140 mAh typical battery^(2) capacity which is the biggest battery of any standard (non-XL) Pixel. It also provides an all day Adaptive Battery experience^(1) which lowers power to processes running in the background and apps you’re unlikely to use.

**Pixel 4a camera**

Pixel 4a has a single, high quality 12MP rear camera with an updated f/1.7 lens that lets in more light than 3a.  We focused on a single high quality camera given zoom/ultra-wide account for a small % of photos taken, and the strong performance of software enabled portrait mode.

**Is Pixel 4a a 5G device? Why not?**

No, Pixel 4a is a 4G device that includes many premium features at a competitive price point. Pixel 5G phones are coming later this year.

GooglePixel,"PSA: If you're getting a new phone in the coming weeks, remember to transfer accounts on any authentication apps before you wipe the old phone!","I use Google Authenticator for 2FA, and twice now I've forgotten to transfer the account before switching phones. Ultimately, that resulted in either a lot of work to get the 2FA removed on a website, or having to create a whole new account. It was something that I really don't want to go through again. 

Tip: If you have a second device (tablet, phone etc...) that can run the same authenticator app, you can transfer it now to get ahead of things. 

Hopefully this saves at least one person a little bit of heartache."
GooglePixel,My Pixel 3 was perfect...until it wasn't.,
GooglePixel,"My Findings on the Pixel 6 Pro's ""10–120 Hz"" Variable Refresh Rate","One of the main advertised features of the Pixel 6 Pro that sets it apart from the normal Pixel 6 is the Pro phone's high variable refresh rate (VRR). [Specifically](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US), the 6 Pro should be able to lower its refresh rate down to 10 Hz to save battery. The question that many people have had is, ***does this actually happen?***

# Android's Refresh Rate Indicator is not reliable for this

Some people have (mistakenly) used Android's refresh rate indicator within the Developer Options to come to the conclusion that the 6 Pro's variable refresh rate only goes down to 60 Hz, because that's what the indicator shows when the screen is idle. However, Android's refresh rate indicator does not show the OLED panel's lowest operating refresh rate, due in part by how its VRR is implemented. The Pixel 6 Pro's Samsung Display panel has a variable refresh rate mechanism that operates at a much lower level, within the display driver, and not exposed to the Android user-space.

# How its ""VRR"" actually works

Samsung's VRR implementation is not the same as those found in typical gaming monitors which can target any arbitrary refresh rate. The VRR found in Samsung's HOP (""LTPO"") panels still work by switching between discrete refresh rate modes, like older implementations, but the new panels now incorporate a [low frequency drive](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16069/samsung-variable-refresh-rate-display-explained-vrr-note20-ultra) (LFD) mechanism which operates the OLED driving rate at a fraction of the current refresh rate mode. As an example, a 10 Hz driving refresh rate is achievable by operating the panel at 60 Hz but skipping re-drives for 5 out of every 6 refresh intervals if the frames are the same. This is made possible by the OLED's new oxide driving TFTs, which has leakage current low enough to pull this off without significant luminance dips.

# Does the display actually go down to 10 Hz?

**Yes**, with some ""buts"".

To figure this out, I initially set out to use a photodiode attached to an oscilloscope so I could create an FFT chart to find the display's fundamental driving frequencies. Luckily, I found out about a flicker meter called the Radex Lupin which comes with software that shows the oscilloscope and FFT Spectrum chart from meter readings. With this newfound tool, I took readings from several scenarios along with some annotations:

1. [Smooth Display enabled, Screen Idle, Normal Lighting](https://i.imgur.com/hEuq5TH.png)
2. [Smooth Display enabled, Screen Idle, Low Ambient Lighting & Low Screen Brightness](https://i.imgur.com/y3b9Drb.png)
3. [Smooth Display disabled / Battery Saver](https://i.imgur.com/Vce9gHt.png)
4. [Forced 120 Hz / Scrolling](https://i.imgur.com/mizetfO.png)
5. [Always-On Display](https://i.imgur.com/GzDmtN5.png)
6. [Smooth Display enabled, 30fps video playback](https://i.imgur.com/vzTzgC0.png)

[*(gallery)*](https://imgur.com/a/rLvQhYK)

**And from (#1), we finally find some solid proof that there is a 10 Hz fundamental driving frequency in the Pixel 6 Pro display when screen content is idle, despite the Android refresh rate indicator reporting 60 Hz.**

Along with it, we find two other fundamental frequencies at 120 Hz and 360 Hz. The peak at 360 Hz is almost certainly the PWM frequency, and 120 Hz is the fundamental refresh frequency from which the 10 Hz LFD is employed from.

However, as [ex-AnandTech writer Andrei has found out](https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1455577873209864198), **the Pixel 6 Pro disables LFD/10 Hz drive at low ambient light + low brightness**, and I found further proof of it (#2). From (#2), we see that the screen goes no lower than 60 Hz in dark conditions. The reasoning behind this is that screen flickering may be noticeable for dark color tones when dark-adapted at such sparse re-drive periods.

**I also tested if the Always-On Display went down to 10 Hz (#5), and I can confirm that it does**. It's driven at a 120 Hz PWM freq. and a 60 Hz fundamental refresh, employing LFD down to 10 Hz. These are all really low flicker frequencies, and from my eyes, AODs have always been prone to flickering, but it doesn't matter much for such little cursory text. However, I can see how it could be a problem for actual phone usage, and why Samsung & Google disabled 10 Hz LFD for low light+brightness. The better solution here however would be to use a higher PWM frequency in low light, à la iPhone 13 Pro (240 Hz).

People have also wondered if the display would go down to 10 Hz with Smooth Display disabled or Battery Saver enabled, and I found out that it keeps the display static at 60 Hz (#3). Counter-intuitive to saving battery, this is a bit of a lousy oversight by Google, and hopefully it's addressed in a future update. Something interesting that I found is that the 60 Hz display mode is still fundamentally driven at 120 Hz, and it implicitly utilizes LFD to achieve 60 Hz. This is supported by Samsung's listed LFD operating modes (via [Anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16069/samsung-variable-refresh-rate-display-explained-vrr-note20-ultra)), which lists the discrete 60 Hz VRR mode as having divider values relative to 120 Hz rather than 60 Hz. Thanks to this and the oxide TFTs, this is also why we don't see changes in screen color calibration when the display shifts between refresh rates.

Lastly, I wanted to see if there was some granularity to the VRR, so I tested if the VRR would try to match the frame rate of a movie or a video (#6). However, whether I played a 24fps movie on Netflix or a 30fps video on YouTube, the Pixel 6 Pro stayed at a static 60 Hz refresh rate. I'd say that this leaves decent room for battery improvement in the future, especially for those that watch a lot of videos on their phones, if Google ever implements this.

# TL;DR

* Pixel 6 Pro goes down to 10 Hz as expected when idle in normal lighting
* In low ambient light & low brightness for darker content, refresh rate only goes down to 60 Hz
* Pixel 6 Pro PWM frequency is 360 Hz, lowering down to 120 Hz at <20% system brightness
* AOD goes down to 10 Hz as expected
* Battery Saver/Smooth Display disabled does not go down to 10 Hz, stays at 60 Hz
* Watching 24fps/30fps movies/videos does not lower refresh rate down to 24/30 Hz, stays at 60 Hz

GooglePixel,My Pixel 2 is working as expected.,That is all. 
GooglePixel,Google sending customers locked phones and charging restock fees for returns,"My wife ordered an Unlocked Pixel 4XL **from the google store**, and when a Verizon SIM card is inserted, it says that the card is not supported and asks her to call Spectrum Wireless to have the phone unlocked.

We have been back and forth with google support for 5 days and we just keep getting the same copy/pasted troubleshooting steps that we have tried several times. Her original SIM card worked in my Pixel 3XL, and her iPhone. However, Google support wasn't going to move until we contacted Verizon, so we did. During a pandemic, she went to the Verizon store and got a new SIM card.

<insert many typical support chat sessions and emails here. 5days!>

After getting a new SIM card from Verizon specifically for the Pixel, and having the same problem, she is still being copy/pasted the same troubleshooting steps 5 days in to ""working with Google Pixel Support""

Considering how bad support has been, she has changed her mind about moving to Android and just wants a refund, and they are saying that there will be a restock fee to return the defective phone that they sent her.

This is Google now.

Please upvote this. I want people to start talking about it. Apparently it has been very common for google to send locked phones to customers who ordered unlocked units, and they have been doing it since December 2019.

&#x200B;

Update:

A support rep finally did start the RMA process, and said that there would be no charges. However, when she got the automated email, it says that she WILL have to pay a restocking fee as well as cover the original shipping cost.

&#x200B;

Update again:

The RMA information on the site still says that she will have these fees. A Pixel Rep is telling us that if the fees are charge we can contact him and they will be refunded. I will update when it's all done and let everyone know how that went.

&#x200B;

Last update: 

The RMA was completed, and it doesn't appear to have charged her anything. In the end, it worked out, but my wife is still an iPhone user, and I'm not sure I'm not going to follow her lead in a few months when the new phones start dropping. Google, you really need to work on your Pixel Customer Service department."
GooglePixel,Google officially sets Pixel 6 launch for Oct 19,
GooglePixel,[Unpopular opinion..] Can we stop making excuses for Google's poor sub-premium hardware and tech?,"I expect to get fully downvoted for this, it's suicide to do it in a sub dedicated to the brand.

I have a Google Pixel 3 XL, 128GB in the UK. Just so you know where I'm coming from. (Oh also... where's my Call Screen at..?)

It seems almost daily that I see people making excuses for Google's tech, and implementation of said tech. Lots of hardware issues, screens that are inconsistent, flagship premium prices but innovation that doesn't match it.

The software, I can't really bash it, I love stock Android, and I love the suggested freedom this gives you. I also LOVE Google's wizardry when it comes to camera processing, it's at this point the BIGGEST reason why I have the phone. No other phone can match the camera processing that Google has worked hard on -note i'm not saying camera, but the software behind it.

Can we maybe start demanding better? For a 1k+ device we should absolutely have the best technology to rival the other flagship devices out there.

Google can't fall back on the software side forever, sure it's true that really when you get to a certain point in tech (OnePlus flagship, Samsung Flagship) you don't really need to push that but actually then focus on software, but Google isn't at that point yet.

TL;DR: Demand more for your money, there's a certain expectation from hardware when it comes to the word flagship, or premium, and Google isn't there. Yet."

GooglePixel,PSA: Random app crashes today? Uninstall Android Webview in Play Store,"There are multiple posts in many subs, including Samsung phones, etc, about random app crashes. If you are experiencing this, please go to the play store and uninstall Android Webview.  This doesn't fully uninstall webview, it only uninstalls the most recent update. But this will get your phone working normally again.

SOME people have reported their phone works after uninstalling AND then reinstalling Android Webview, but it did not on my wife's phone (4a 5G).  Best to just stick to uninstalling Android Webview.

Hope this helps!"
GooglePixel,This sub has become so rude and disrespectful,"Just saw someone who got their first Pixel asking about a defect (they didn't know it was a defect) in the comments of their post. People downvoted them and rudely told them what it was and how to deal with it. When the person simply showed a sign of being upset about it, they were downvoted and told by another to ""stop whining"" and ""figure it out"". That othrr person was upvoted.

What is wrong with this sub? That is a first time Pixel user asking simple questions and being given such trashy treatment in response. If I were them, I wouldn't have even wanted a replacement if my first phone from a company were defective. Forget the fact that the Pixel community was also trash to them.

Awful.

GooglePixel,Google Store accidentally sent me a case of Pixel 4 phones instead of the one phone I ordered,"I ordered a unlocked Just Black Pixel 4 64GB phone online on sale for $499 plus tax, but much to my surprise I received a case of phones (10 in total) from Fed-Ex two days later. - So 9 extra phones (this is important later). I gotta be honest, for a moment it felt like winning the lottery, but it was only a moment as angel on my shoulder, and my wife, both spoke up, and I knew there was only one choice:

I informed Google customer service, with a little tear in my eye of the mistake over through the chat, and I think they were a little taken aback. At first they requested a photo of the packing slip, and then a picture of the extra phones, which I provided - I informed them that I removed one of the phones - hence the picture had only 9 boxes in it. They ask me to wait 3 separate times, and then sent me an email 2 days later letting me know that Fed-Ex would be stopping by to pick them up. The tracking slip only had a quantity of 8. 

Talk about rubbing salt in the wound, but  I contacted Google customer service again to ask them how to proceed. After more deliberation they told me to return 8 and they would send a tracking slip for the ninth separately.

Edited: The picture
https://imgur.com/a/sgCMJGa
 
Update: The extra 9 phones have been returned to Google, it did take over a week to get the packing slip on the last one, but with Covid-19 I am not surprised. Google did reach out to me via e-mail, thanking me for returning the phones, and gave me $40 credit for the Google store, which is where I bought the phone(s) from, though they didn't have too, and I didn't request it. I appreciate all of your responses on here, even the ones inferring I am stupid for returning them.  Everytime a situation like this occurs everyone wants to know the reason, the person returned the (money, phone etc) they found.  I wish I had a better answer, but it just came down to it was the right thing to do."
GooglePixel,"After six months of dealing with Google Support, they closed my case by incorrectly telling me my warranty has expired.","This is the easiest I've ever gotten out of bed. Woke up to [this](https://imgur.com/YqupSe3) email and was upset enough to come immediately to Reddit. Will likely follow up on Twitter.


Maybe my response wasn't the most appropriate, but it is two days short of six months that they've been giving me the run-around. I have sworn by this phone for the majority of time I've had with it. In June, my battery started being finnicky and my phone would shut down randomly at anywhere from 5% to 15%. I had also recieved numerous reports that my mic was not working correctly and that has only continued to get worse. I can usually only have phone calls over bluetooth now.


So, I contacted live support and they created a ticket for me. I was initially very optimistic, as the representative helping me was incredibly active and attentive in doing what he needed to.

It seemed the issue was that my warranty wasn't being recognized because it wasn't attached to my current device. I'd gotten two replacements-- one, I dropped it and the screen cracked, and then, two, they sent me a replacement that stopped working almost immediately after I got it. They replaced the faulty one immediately and told me it would not count against my device warranty, as it was mailed faulty.


But, my initial representative identified the issue and moved the warranty to my device-- or so he said. I then was assigned a new representative and recieved [this](https://imgur.com/Fr4Ck9n) for the following five months. 

Today, I was told that my warranty was expired and that they could be of no help. [Here](https://imgur.com/xx0qHgE) is a copy of my receipt, showing that my warranty isn't expired. This is included in the very first of [OVER 70 emails](https://imgur.com/XO1GBK3) that we exchanged just trying to get me a phone that I could use to actually call people!

This also indicates that my first support representative did not do what he told me he did and move my warranty.

I am very frustrated. I don't know what to do at this point. I will be opening another ticket and be posting this anywhere online that I can. I hope that someone here could provide guidance, or, better yet, someone from support who is actually willing to resolve my issue sees this. 

I just want a working phone.


TL;DR- Bought warranty with OG Pixel. Wasn't on my account for some reason. Google support said they fixed it. Five months later, they tell me otherwise and close my ticket.


Thanks for reading.


EDIT: First of all, I'd like to thank you guys for all the support. It's *looking like* this is going to get resolved and that's exciting.

u/dmziggy was an immediate help and I wanted to explicitly say that I appreciate their help. I have received a support email, a response here in this thread, and some correspondence through my Reddit Request ticket.

Again, thank you all. I'll keep you updated on what goes on.

Oh, and thanks for the silver! :)


EDIT 2: They have mailed me a replacement and also given me a $50 gift card for my troubles. I'm frustrated that it took so much to get to this point, but I'm happy it's getting resolved. Again, big thank you to everyone here. (:"

GooglePixel,A public plea for Google to make a small Pixel,"I recently tried to use the Pixel 7 (coming from the Pixel 4a, used the Pixel 2 previously) and I just can't get used to the size difference.

I'm not sure if there are others who experience the same thing, but 6.3"" for a phone seems to be on the larger/near unusable side for me. It's not even being able to reach across the width of the screen, it's how tall the thing is and cumbersome it is to carry around. It feel slippery with the glass, the bump doesn't work for holding it with smaller/regular sized hands as well.

I'm curious if others have experienced the same thing. I imagine this shift to larger screens is matching the time and what sales figures dictate, but Google - please consider those of us who enjoy a smaller phone!

Edit: First, lots of mentions of the Pixel 6a. Although it has a smaller screen, it has nearly the same footprint as the Pixel 7, so it's simply not a ""small"" phone

Second, Asus Zenfone 9. I'm not sure how well it will work with my phone plan, but I'm willing to give it a shot, especially because it's quite close to stock android. I may update with a later post! Not sure if that's allowed though, as it's technically not Pixel-related.

Final update (in case anyone is reading): Zenfone wasn't for me. Camera wasn't good at all, and software support is too lacking to justify. Going to hold out as long as I can with the 4a. Might have to jump into the world of iPhone in a year..."

This makes so much sense.

* Google doesn't have Apple's supply chain or shops.
* Android's USP is 'open source' vs Apple's walled garden.

Google can never compete against Apple's repair capabilities.

Giving customers their own parts and tools is a brilliant counter move.

GooglePixel,"Pixel prevented me from calling emergency services... THREE YEARS AGO. I reported the issue on this subreddit AND on Google's Issue Tracker and it got ""escalated"". What happened?","Three years ago, I got hit by a motorcycle and tried to call emergency services on my Pixel. My Pixel tried to send my location to emergency services, failed, and froze entirely. When I rebooted and tried again, the exact same thing happened. **I couldn't call for an ambulance on my Pixel.**

After I reported it on this subreddit, people advised me to report the issue in Google's Issue Tracker immediately. So I did. And u/dmziggy said that [he had escalated the issue](https://www.unddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8z725h/_/e2i5ak3/), and that [""the right people know about it""](https://www.unddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8z725h/_/e2jcae7/).

GooglePixel,Please allow us to save 911 as a contact so that it masks who we're calling in an emergency.,"Nearly got into an altercation today because I called 911 after seeing some dude beat his GF.  Dude noticed me on the phone and ran over, started threatening me that he'd kill me if I was calling 911. I insisted I was calling my wife and he insisted that I show my phone to him. Thankfully, I had a bit of a safety net with bystanders nearby - nonetheless, it would have been great if I could have shown my phone and not worry about the huge ""Emergency Call.""  

Dear any Google employee who frequents this subreddit: please send feedback to the appropriate people so we can optionally assign fake contacts to 911 or emergency numbers so that the average user won't know we're calling 911.  This would also be super helpful for those who are victims of domestic violence who are trying to reach for help. This feature might actually save lives. As someone who did dispatch for two years a while ago, the call that haunts me the most is the one where the woman called 911 on her Motorola RAZR and her husband shot her after seeing it. 

For the location bit, perhaps consider moving it to the top bar so you can swipe to see it, or in a modal dialog so it can be closed immediately if needed. Alternatively, maybe enable a trigger to hide it such as volume up and down while removing the phone from your ear.

From a development standpoint, this is super low cost to implement."

I chose selfie video so that I have a recording of myself so that I do not potentially violate any laws. Feel free to modify it anyway you want.

If anyone has any recommendations on how to tweak this please let me know and I will update.

\* I have shared my Google Photos with my fiance so she has access to any time. Also I am on unlimited data with Google Fi so my Google Photos is set to backup on mobile data (so no need to change that setting).

*There are some limitations for for Google Assistant and what it can automate on your phone. If you want a more complete solution look at IFTTT, Tasker, AutomateIT, and others.*

**Edit:** I am making edits as recommendations for modifications come in.

**Edit 2:** Please take a look at ACLU Mobile Justice and download the App. You can easily edit the above Routine to ask your phone to open that app:  [https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct) and at the ACLU Know Your Rights page:  [https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/)

**Edit 3:**  from [Aperture\_Kubi](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aperture_Kubi) \-  Slight problem if you're trying to do this in your home and you have Google Home hardware that picks up the command instead.

**Edit 4 REQUEST:** Has anyone been able to get Google Assistant to auto stream to any platform? If yes, please tag me in your comment and I will update the post with your instructions.

**Edit 5**: A few folks have commented on the laws of recording interactions with police. Summary: Notify the police that the interaction is being recorded. Please check with your state laws on recording during traffic stops. The ACLU link above has some great details on your rights.

**Edit 6**:  from [andyooo](https://www.reddit.com/user/andyooo) \-  There are apps like Nova Launcher mentioned below (and Tasker) that have a ""system lock"" action, which disables biometrics (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7imzv1/tip_quickly_disable_fingerprint_unlock_and/) for more). This necessarily requires device admin permission so you have to reasonably trust the app. Someone in the comments mentioned [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsc.lock) and said they were using exactly in the way you intend it too, just add ""open Lock"" to your Assistant routine. If you don't trust the app but trust Tasker and Tasker Factory's developer, you can use them to make a ""system lock"" task, then export it as app and give it any name you want (e.g. so it's unambiguous to Assistant what it should ""open""). Going that way I'd recommend targeting an older API because targeting a recent one for some reason requires the app running as a foreground service.

**Edit 7**: from [xcheet](https://www.reddit.com/user/xcheet) \-  Google Home is not needed. Routines can be created inside Assistant using the instructions on this page: [Check Google Support](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7672035?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) "

GooglePixel,Pixel over iPhone... it's NOT about the Customization,"**\*\*\*Disclaimer\*\*\***

This post is NOT another ""here's why the Pixel is better than the iPhone"" rant. **It's a rant against tech sites** who seem to only mention Android's customization as the primary advantage over iOS when making their comparisons. If you're here to reply with ""but iPhones are better because of x,y, and z,"" then please don't bother replying and move on to the next thread.

**Original Post**

Every Android vs iOS comparison I read [lists the iPhone advantages and then lists a few Android advantages](https://www.androidcentral.com/why-i-carry-iphone-and-android-phone). However, they always start off the Android section with the SAME advantage... Customization.

Well guess what, iPhone users don't care about customization; otherwise, they'd be using Android. I'm here to lay out some actual, functional advantages to using Android (specifically, the Google Pixel series):

1. File Management - not only can you easily access the internal file structure from the phone, you can plug it into a computer and read it like a flash drive. This makes file management SUPER easy and effective on Android.
2. Mobile Data - Android does not restrict you from using your mobile data to download ""large"" files >150 mb. What's the point of having unlimited data plans if you have to connect to WiFi just to download a game or music album?
3. Cross-platform Compatibility - seriously, why should I have to buy a $1,500 Mac Book just to send text messages from my computer? Android Messages works through ANY browser. Plus, NFC actually works for more than just mobile payments.
4. Deeper 3rd Party App Integration - ""but, Snap Chat looks better on iPhone!"" ....FVCK SNAPCHAT!  I'm talking about 3rd party apps being crippled on iOS because iOS doesn't play nicely with anything that doesn't have an Apple logo on it. Take Google Photos for example. The key feature is the cloud backups to preserve your photos in case anything happens to your device. But if you have an iPhone, you can't even count on the app to backup photos unless you open the G\_Photos app, manually start the backup process, and then don't switch to a different app because of my next point...
5. True Multi-Tasking - forget the fact that Pixels can run split screen apps or picture in picture. I'm talking about simply starting a process on one app, and switching to another app WITHOUT the first app pausing the process. It's not really a smart phone if the iPhone can't run processes in the background.
6. Everything Else - better notification management, faster LTE/WiFi modems, fast charging included standard, native USB-C support, in-app settings management (seriously, I have to exit the app I'm using and dig through the long a\*\* general settings menu to change an app-specific setting?), more advance sharing options, and I'm sure there's a ton more...

But in just 5 minutes, I was able to list a bevy of genuine advantages the Pixel series has over the iPhone series, and I did so without ONCE mentioning, ""But the customization!"" These tech reviewers need to start digging deeper than just their home screen layouts on these phones. No one is going to give Android any serious consideration if they think the only advantage is changing the shape/color of the app icons.

GooglePixel,I don't know what kind of black magic the Pixel 7 is using to screen robocalls but I'm never buying a phone that can't do this.,"On my S22(same number) I was getting 8-9 calls a day plus several scam texts. In the week I've had the Pixel 7 Pro I've gotten exactly one text message and one phone call that was screened with the Assistant and that was it.

I just didn't realize it was going to work so well or at all. Its my favorite feature without a doubt and I ain't ever buying a phone without it."
GooglePixel,Gentle reminder for Anyone who just got a new Pixel,"Every single year since the original Pixel, people have come to Reddit and expressed extreme disappointment with the battery, The performance, and features not working just as they expected. 

Then within a month, the trend is to reverse that position.  The battery starts working better the features work more like expected, etc.

There are many factors that create this, but some are the built-in optimization functions of the phone sorting themselves out, others is patches that come after release, and then there's an inherent extreme usage that we have when we first get a new phone. The user is using their phone more, apps were just downloaded and so they are downloading their data and optimizations, etc. 

Already you can see people on this forum saying that it's a miracle now (compared to a few days ago) their batteries running a lot longer and the phone is heating up much less. I predict we will continue to see this trend. 

If you search message history back to every pixel release you'll see a similar result."

The Pixel 7 Pro has been an amazing experience so far and I believe it's on par with the Apple iPhone. There's only one thing that Apple does that I really believe gives them a significant competitive edge over the Pixel phones, and that most tech normies recognize, and that is customer service and post-purchase support. 

Why doesn't Google implement a Genius Bar-like service at their Google stores? Where, like with Apple, if I'm under warranty or have Apple Care, I can get my screen replaced or the entire phone replaced if needed. 

Google's online tech support and on-the-phone customer service is atrocious and unhelpful - virtually non-existent.

If Google implements these critical services, I think it would motivate quite a bit of customers to join Pixel. Customers want to know they have somewhere to go if they have a hardware issue with their phone. I just don't know if they're making the revenue on Pixel to justify such a service and the needed infrastructure."

https://photos.app.goo.gl/LGQ4TL7JctmmEM3o8

1. The curve really isn't too bad. Screen looked great - crazy fast compared to my 3 and noticably brighter

2. Zoom looked really good. I included .7, 1, 2, 4, and 20x. 20 is obviously not acceptable for normal pictures but it still has okay details

3. New stabilization options (unless I just never knew other pixels had those)

4. Couldn't find the new dynamic photo feature but magic eraser works well enough. Still not as good as a manual Photoshop but unless you're looking for errors you probably wouldn't notice someone was removed from a pic

5. Squeeze for assistant is gone but now holding the power button triggers assistant! Not sure if you can change it in settings

Edit: I'm thinking of going back tomorrow when I have more time to check audio quality and vibration haptics, anything else I should look at?

E2: Checking audio quality vs 6, front camera pro vs 6, haptics vs 6, (manual) screen brightness vs 6, viewing angles of Pro vs 6, double tap for camera, photos upload, square picture, face unlock, macro/distance to object, PIP, palm rejection, volume steps, model numbers, gesture nav options, 24 fps, online gpu test, fingerprints, polarized glasses, outgoing call, streamable, 6 max zoom pic

E3: https://photos.app.goo.gl/V9hH7hYvHG78E6Jn7

I couldn't use the pro at all because the pixel area was really busy 👀, but I tried to check most things

First I'm going to go through features that weren't there and one concern after that there's no particular order

One of the pixel 6's was really low on battery (even though they have it plugged in all the time?) And it was definitely running slower than the other  
There was no square picture mode, 24 fps option, UW autofocus, outgoing call confirmation, unlimited photo upload, or face unlock

For audio quality: there's a front and bottom firing speaker. They sound good but not amazing, get loud but not crazy loud

The front camera of the 6 was noticably worse than the pro. Not bad but not great either. It might just be the pre release software but it seems worse than my 3

I included a picture of the notification bar height. It is centered on the camera cutout which sucks, but most of the apps had it blend into the UI well

The minimum focus distance of the 6 camera was pretty far

The haptics were sharp but weak for my liking

Screen viewing angles and brightness was very good for both

There were 25 steps for the volume, same as my 3 in Android 12

I have a picture with the model number of a pixel 6

You can still use 3 button navigation

You can easily get fingerprints on the back, but they aren't glaringly obvious. It was really hard to even get a picture of them showing

Max zoom of the 6 was 7x and it looked fine. It looks to me like there's more detail than the 20x(5x digital) on the pro but idk

I also took a video of the different stabilization demos because it looked cool lol"

GooglePixel,Beware of Google's warranty scam,"I LOVE my Pixel 5, but you need to be aware Google support is now using ANY wear and tear to justify not repairing your phone and honoring the warranty.

I sent my phone in, at their request, to fix a software issue, and they told me due to ""damage"" they wouldn't fix the phone unless I paid $180. I told them there wasn't damage, asking them if they broke it, and that's when they started playing games. They refused to tell me what the damage was, refused to send me a photo, but wanted me to pay without any confirmation. 

After hanging up on me 4 times, and after nearly 70 emails back and forth, each time with a new person, I finally confirmed the ""damage"" was a scratch on the bottom of the phone. They confirmed the phone had problems that were under warranty, but wouldn't fix them because they said they don't fix phones anymore. Instead, they only replace them because repairs are too expensive. To qualify for a replacement, they can't have any signs of wear and tear.

One guy actually went through the fine print with me line by line, and when he discovered he was wrong said ""this will help your case"" and then he turned it over to a higher tier, where the entire cycle started over. 

Finally—after getting a rep to admit there was nothing in their fine print that voided my warranty, they granted me an ""exception"" BUT mailed my broken phone back to me. After I told them the error, they simply said to send it back in and we will check, asking me to submit a new support ticket.  They said now they can't send a repair because I took too long! 

Beware, if your phone has any wear and tear and suffers a problem, you're screwed. Their warranty is essentially a scam.

1. Some users (and a Google employee who messaged me) said I misrepresenting how damaged my phone was. I JUST got it back today and here's the photo. Feel free to message me your apology.

3) 60Hz on an iPhone might be a great performer. That's all fine. Even 6a isnt that terrible. My issue is how the youtubers made it such a big deal with 6a but not a mention of the travesty of it all with iPhone. There's definitely a marketing mafia at play here.

GooglePixel,Beware when trading in your Pixel devices to Google,"I recently had a very upsetting experience with Google on a trade in issue.  I had a Pixel 4, in excellent condition, I babied that phone, always was in a protective case and used with Google approved chargers and accessories.

I decided to trade in the Pixel 4 for a Pixel 5 because Google was offering $290 for my 4, I didn't really need a new phone because the phone worked great, but the credit for trade was too good to pass up.  I ran diagnostics, factory reset the phone and sent it in the provided box - I was confident knowing the phone was in tip top shape.

Well, much to my surprise I get an email from Google, they devalued my Pixel 4 and are only giving me $58 in credit.  I was like WHAT????  That is a $232 dollar difference!  I promptly contacted Google support, I tried my best not to take out my irritation on the customer service rep, but he said the phone was devalued by $232 because the battery exploded / or was bloated.  Hmm, so my phone was working perfectly, passed the diagnostics, and then when Google gets it, it powers on with an exploded battery!!

I let the CSR know that I wanted this issue resolved, a quick internet search and you can see that a replacement battery is about $70, yet Google devalues my phone by $232?  I gave Google 2 choices, either Google return my phone, or give me more credit, because $58 is insulting and damn near criminal if you ask me.  I even offered to pay for the shipping to return my old phone.

The CSR said that I marked the box to not return my phone, so they couldn't (ok, this was clearly before I knew that Google would rip me off), and they were not going to credit me anything additional.  This was the most piss poor customer service I have received in a long time, I am sooo disappointed in Google, they literally lost my respect in an instant.

I let the CSR know that I have spent thousands on Google products, and I have encouraged my friends and family to do the same, but no longer.  I will tell everyone and everybody that will listen about my Google experience, and I will be phasing out anything I have from Google.  Google might have made $232, but they just lost thousands in future revenue and my respect, and to think I was considering signing up for FI, lol! glad I dodged that bullet.  Google customer service = Comcast imo.

It's not about the money to me, it's about the principle.  Why not send me my old phone back?  Would it be really that hard to do, or just offer me a credit of some kind?  I clearly took very good care of the phone, and if it did have a battery issue that says more about Google workmanship than my treatment of the phone.

TLDR - sorry for the long post, I just wanted to get my story out to anyone that was thinking about trading in their Google devices for new ones.

\*Update\*

Thanks to [dmziggy](https://www.reddit.com/user/dmziggy/) for being able to facilitate a resolution with Google support.  I wasn't expecting that Google would make this right, but I received a message from them today saying that they were going to credit me the full $290 for the trade-in.  This was more than I expected, after being told to go pound sand just days earlier."
GooglePixel,"Verizon says ""There is no truth to this report"" that it will stop selling Google's Pixel phones. ""Verizon continues to work with Google and looks forward to the new portfolio of devices.""",
GooglePixel,Google Now: From Useful to Useless,
GooglePixel,Pixel 5 is the best phone I have ever had hands down. I don't understand any of the hate that it got.,"So I know there's been so many of these posts but I just wanted to be another voice to say that all these reviewers who are saying the pixel 5 is bad are looking at it from such weird angle. 

I got my pixel 5 a few days ago to replace my OnePlus 6. My pixel has been hands down already a better experience. I know that the OnePlus 6 was one of their peak phones: super snappy, great screen for its price and awesome build quality - but the pixel 5 with its ""worse"" processor and un-flagship nature is 100% better. 

I've been able to do everything that I could do on my OnePlus 6 just as, if not better, on my pixel. It's snappy, super smooth and looks even better playing games like real racing and PUBG compared to my 6 thanks to its 90hz and graphics. Even though the pixel has a ""budget"" processor it absolutely flies through tasks despite it being a little worse than the 845 my old phone had on paper. 

Things that people have been complaining about like speakers, haptics or build seem to me as completely wrong. I love the way that the sound comes right at you through the screen like on those expensive Sony TV's. And the haptics are honestly up there with the typing experience on my GF's iPhone XS. I also love the playful sorta sage and the feel of it. It almost looks like it's made of felt or something when you look at it. With the built in positives of wireless charging and water proofing. 

Battery life has also been stellar and the 5G speeds and reliability are absolutely awesome.

So, I honestly hate how much this phone copped from reviewers and users. 

Yes it's different to the fully fledged, throw everything we have approach of previous pixels but I'm very happy with the lower processor but keeping everything else to give me a flagship phone for $999AUD compared to the $1250 or $1400 for other flagships. For me in Australia this has been cheaper than even a oneplus or s20 fe with a free nest hub max to sweeten the deal. 

Nobody really uses their phone for demanding tasks and I reckon you'd be hard pressed to notice an improvement between the pixel 5 and other flagships like the S20. People seem to think that everyone needs the best processor for all the 4K editing and hardcore gaming they're going to be doing. Nobody actually cares, the difference between recent processors and performance have been so minimal you couldn't blindly tell the difference between a phone from 3 years ago vs today. 90hz or above is the new and only way to make a phone feel faster. 

TL:DR the obsession of critics and reviewers that no price of tech is good unless it has the cutting edge features even if it's completely overkill has given this phone some very mixed reviews and receptions. Anyone who was to buy this one would be hard pressed to find a major flaw. It's got everything you need in a phone for a cheaper price."

How much longer will we have to endure this on iOS group chats?"
GooglePixel,Compilation of why Android 12 is not so good [with screenshots],"What the hell are you doing, Google?

After updating(Pixel 4), I have noticed a couple of really bad design elements, disallowing the person to choose what's best for them and then - plain worsening of the usability aspects.

""Pixel that adapts to you"" my ass. Changing accent colors based on wallpaper is marketed as advanced adapting? Taking away the user's options is the worst thing that Google could do to their customers - people who enjoy customization & advanced users who use Android devices for a reason.

Here is a list of some of the ""this is dumb"" experiences I have found from my usage, and from others as well

1. Lock screen clock. It's huge, it's not adjustable in any way and it looks ugly (this, of course, depends on the person, but not having the ability to change it is pretty wild) [https://postimg.cc/V51VthNj/a3650fda](https://postimg.cc/V51VthNj/a3650fda)
2. Clock widget on the home screen. What is up with the ugly ass background, why can't we have an option to enjoy the wallpaper that we as users CHOOSE to set. Wasn't this what the marketing was all about? Phone adjusting to ME? This is just purely idiotic decision - why wouldn't you leave the old widgets as well, why do you have to push such shitty UI elements onto people? [https://postimg.cc/ZBY6b6Ty](https://postimg.cc/ZBY6b6Ty)   
edit: this seems to be a bug. some people(including me) are not seeing the option to remove the background, some are.   

3. Can't click on the date in the ""At a glance"" widget to open Calendar. (From comments) You can't click on the clock in the notification shade as well anymore.
4. The bubbly/stretchy animation - it's smooth, but it's not really nice seeing my whole screen bouncing around when I get to the bottom or top of something. This is especially noticeable in The App Drawer. This now feels like a kid's toy, not a device that power users could use.
5. Quick toggles - I for one don't mind the new design, but the fact that you can't change how round the borders are and how much space there is in the toggles themselves - that's just wasted space. On a similar note - it's impossible to flick-swipe the toggles away now. You have to swipe up 2 times, instead of 1 flick, to return to the app you were using. [https://postimg.cc/Hjqj3bf4](https://postimg.cc/Hjqj3bf4)
6. What's a lot worse - is the fact that, for some reason, Google decided that transparent backgrounds are the enemy of state and forced solid background in both - app drawer and app switcher (and probably elsewhere). What makes it worse though, is how bad it's done. If you go in an app, press and pull the app switcher up (without releasing), the background is your wallpaper. Only after you release - the background becomes solid. (From comments) This also happens for the notification shade, even if you don't have any notifications... WHAT PROBLEM DOES THIS SOLVE OTHER THAN ME NOT BEING ABLE TO ENJOY MY WALLPAPER? [https://postimg.cc/gallery/zK9pBGx](https://postimg.cc/gallery/zK9pBGx)
7. Continuing with the idiotic design elements - The App Drawer. It doesn't look half bad, until you start scrolling. Suddenly a big gray rectangle appears at the top. For some reason the search bar is sticky, with an ugly solid background, and, of course, there's no way to change it. [https://postimg.cc/gallery/zv5qW83](https://postimg.cc/gallery/zv5qW83)
8. The ""styling"" of the Google Launcher. You can't change the style of little icons anymore, you can't change the style of big icons, you can't change the fonts, you can't change the accent colors to anything else than the bland 4 colors that are provided by Google. You basically can't do anything customization-wise, that you could on Android 11.[https://postimg.cc/94ZXzfmP](https://postimg.cc/94ZXzfmP)
9. And now to the worst offender - the notifications. Grouping is different (worse), each notification in the shade takes up a lot more space - not because there's more information, but because of the rounded corners and added spacing in each notification. One message takes up half the screen, basically. [https://postimg.cc/Hc3g7cfM](https://postimg.cc/Hc3g7cfM)
10. (From comments) Everything looks monotonous.
11. (From comments) At a glance widget taking up the whole width of the screen for some reason.
12. (From comments) Font size feels too big. If you go into settings and change it - then it's too small. There's a noticeable ""gap"" between the settings now, where you can't get the font to be ""just right"".

Don't get me wrong - the update is probably a good thing, but the ""minor"" things that Google has left in there - that look plain ugly, that worsens the experience, that ruins the look of the device completely is too much to handle.

In addition - I'm usually very open minded to visual changes and different experiences, but this update, especially from UI/UX perspective just feels cheap. It feels like I traded in my smartphone for a toy.

I would like for someone at Google to read this, but they probably won't, and probably wouldn't care anyways. For the first time since owning the device I'm feeling like I will have to go with custom rom to be able to adjust MY experience with the device.

Google has released first hardware upgrade for their cameras in years - that could welcome a lot of new users. The new Tensor chip sounds awesome as well. The price is very aggressively set.

But every single thing of that won't matter, if the software experience feels cheap and looks like crap.

Rant over, cheers.

GooglePixel,This year I FINALLY had the absolute pleasure of having my family prefer the photos my Pixel 6 Pro made over the ones taken by my sister's iPhone 12,"I have been waiting to join the Pixel family since the very introduction of the first Pixel. Every year, I would postpone it because there was always something that wouldn't convince me, and so I would stick to OnePlus phones that were indeed awesome, but really lacked in the photo department. 

Each year, the moment for family photos would come, and I would just let my sister do all the work with her iphone because there was simply no competition. 

This year I finally joined the Google family with my Pixel 6 Pro and I was ready to challenge the iPhone regime. 

We started with both phones taking pictures, and it was tense. After the first 4-5 pics, we let each family member thoroughly look at each photo and decide who should take the crown, and after a close inspection the verdict was up : they asked to take more pics using only MY Pixel 6 Pro. I'm telling you, I never felt more proud. 

In my household, my father, my mother and my sister all use iPhones, I was always the only one using Android phones. So this was even more of a satisfaction. 

I know it's silly, but I'm so glad that they commented with things like ""oh yeah his photos are MUCH better, way more colorful and stuff"". It really made my day.

GooglePixel,Google changed my device trade in value from $350 to $17.50.,"Traded in a Note 10+ and just got an email saying my trade in was credited for $17.50 with absolutely no explanation. There were no issues with the device, it was free of cracks, turned on, and was factory reset. Anyone else have them reject a trade in?

Update: I spoke with CS and they are ""opening an investigation."" They say the reason for the lower credit is that there was a model mismatch. The email I got says ""Reported device condition: Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (256GB Other)"" and ""Condition when received : Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (256GB Other). Obviously the same model. I'm highly skeptical that they will actually correct it. But I have a video of the device on the initial setup screen, showing no scratches or cracks, powering down, and being packed in the trade in kit. I also have the receipt from Samsung showing the model. I'll continue to fight.

Edit: I know that I could get probably double that for a Note 10+ by selling it but I'm busy and it was convenient to just trade in as part of the purchase. I expected that selling it elsewhere would be more of a headache but here we are.

GooglePixel,Anyone else wish for a smaller pixel phone?,"I really enjoyed the pixel 3 size, it was not too big, not too small and just perfect. Curious to see if anyone else would also enjoy a new smaller sized pixel.

GooglePixel,Home alone by Google ;),
GooglePixel,"If Google built a phone with the body of a Galaxy S10 and the software of a Pixel, it would sell like crazy","Obviously this is hypothetical. Google Pixels are wonderful devices, I own one, and I'll be buying the 4 XL in Q4. However, the hardware in the Samsung Galaxy devices is just so much better. The only reason I don't buy Samsung phones is because of the sofware. I don't like OneUI (haters gonna hate), I love stock Android, I love quick updates, I love the smooth snappy nature of my 2 XL.

If Google could bring this, plus all the Pixel-specific stuff to a phone with the hardware of an S10/S10+, then I'd buy it. The better screen, the bigger battery, the build quality, the thin bezels, all of it. It's a shame this would never happen, but we can dream.

The only thing I'd miss is squeeze for assistant, I love it.  


EDIT: Thanks for all the comments. I'm not suggesting doing this would launch Google ahead of Samsung (although if that's their goal then they would have to do this + advertise more). These are just my thoughts on how Google could vastly improve their sales numbers, I'm not saying this would be the end of Samsung. I forgot to mention that I'd expect it to keep dual front-firing speakers, and even the two-toned rear design would be fine. Wasn't necessarily talking about the curved edges either. I meant the internals (more RAM, storage, bigger battery) + screen tech (better AMOLED, pin-hole design, small bezels) of a Samsung."
GooglePixel,"Well, it finally happened to me from Google.","Bought the Pixel 7 and Google said they'd offer $250 on our Pixel 3 trade-in, so I accepted that method.  Our Pixel 3 had been fully cases since day one, zero cracks, zero scratches, and functioned great. Absolutely nothing wrong with the phone in our consumer eyes.

Made a video of it working and me packing it up for trade-in. I sent it off on Saturday and I wake up this morning to find it had been assessed, found that the battery was swollen, and that the new value was zero!

We had no indication when looking at the phone of a swollen battery issue. Absolutely nothing whatsoever. I would have not kept and used the phone if a swollen battery issue was present, let alone try to trade it in when claiming perfect condition.

I showed her the end result and seeing her eyes light up and have her laugh and smile made my day.  So while I've had my frustrations about the pixel, this moment was something only it could give me. Thanks Pixel team.

TL:DR- I used magic eraser to bring my grieving wife a good memory of her father.

EDIT: Wow I was not expect awards for this. Thanks for all the kind words and thoughts. I posted this story just to show how a simple phone feature brought my wife and I a smile and I'm glad it brought some of y'all one too. Sadly everybody loses somebody and people grieve differently but any little ray of sunshine helps."

These always get dreadful reviews. Never cheap enough. Battery never big enough. Too slow. Not enough storage. Blah, blah, blah as far as I'm concerned. 

Family and friends ask me what phone to get because I used to be a computer guy. Been recommending pixels since they started making them. Zero complaints from probably 15 or so people that bought em.

Reading half the comments on this sub one is ridiculous. People want headphone jack, top of the line processor, 16 GB ram, perfect 1080p 60 fps video and can store 80 GB video files, the best camera, AND a sub $500 price. I could go on.

Pixels have the best software, best camera, and a reasonable price. I'm beyond excited for a phone with an edge to edge screen and decent battery size.

GooglePixel,A plea to Google: please invest in your customer service and aftercare support to have any chance of competing in this market.,"Great Customer service and after care support are essential in today’s consumerist world. I’m a huge Google fan and have had their devices since the nexus tablets. But no matter how good and how smart their devices become, if things go south we need to be able to rely on their help. I read negative experiences daily about Google support and their 3rd party service centres on this sub. It pains me to see so many people leave android to iOS purely because of this reason. This is literally a plea to Google that no matter what product they release on may 10th, in October, next year, etc, people want a brand they can trust and we need Google to invest in this area.

-Not having your own service centres is not good enough.
-Not having a physical store apart from in the US in todays market is not good enough.
-The hours of troubleshooting your agents make people do before approving a return or exchange over chat/phone is not good enough."

I just upgraded from a Pixel 4a to a 6a, and finding myself annoyed at the size upgrade. Not only is it taller by almost a centimeter (and I have relatively small hands) but the weight difference is quite noticeable.   


iPhone has several sizes available, including the mini and the SE. Would it kill Google to come out with an actual low-end phone? Anyone else feeling overburdened this year?"
GooglePixel,Anyone else staying to have second thoughts about continuing as a Google user in the future?,"Like, don't get me wrong, i just bought a pixel 4a 5g and I'm loving it. I'll use this phone until it's time to move on. That being said, the revelation that future pixels will no longer feature unlimited cloud storage, along with Google's recent dropping of previously available consumer-friendly features elsewhere (looking at you, photos app), and now just today seeing them say that the Google Pay app is going to start charging fees for instant transfers... And then there's the big uptick in ads on YouTube that started recently, as well as the terms of service saying they're going to start putting ads on small creators videos without adding them to the partners program. I'm really seeing Google move in this direction of ""taking features away one inch at a time, not giving you anything in return, and hoping you don't notice."" 

Like, pixel user from day one here. I went Pixel XL - 3A XL - 4A 5G. I don't want to move away because i love the stock android experience and the awesome quality of the photos. But like, the google user future is looking pretty bleak right now, right?

Like, hoping the company proves me wrong but it's not looking like that's the case right now. Might have to look towards OnePlus or even that Sony Xperia line in the future.

Hardware updates cannot be considered ""no issue"".

Yes it might be a hair slower in some situations, but I've not had one instance where I needed to use my pin instead of my fingerprint to unlock. How is everyone having so many issues with this?  

Additionally, to those who say bring back the rear facing fingerprint scanner, I say nay. I like having it on the front of my screen and not having to pick up my phone while at my desk. Maybe switch to an ultrasonic on the next Pixel. I know I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but most of you are making a way bigger deal out of this than it is."

I would be checking for updates steadying tech news analyzing how my phone worked.

GooglePixel,pixel 6 pro failed to connect to 911 last week.,"Google is knowingly still selling phones that won't connect to 911 and it almost cost my child his life last week. My Pixel 6 Pro failed to connect to 911 over 17 times. I purchased it directly from Google /Google Fi in August. I do not, nor have I ever had Teams installed. I've not had any other call or service failures prior to or after. The issue is exclusive to calling emergency services. 

Details: 
On 9/27/22, I received a call from my sitter saying that my five year old had begun seizing and was unresponsive. I told her I was on my way, and I would call 911. (So that she could focus on my child and trying to keep him safe under the circumstances) I tried calling 911 at least 17 times on my Google Pixel 6 Pro from the time I left my office, and it failed to connect every single time. I tried dialing direct from the keypad, I tried from the emergency lock screen, I tried everything. I'd not had any service or call issues before that point. Thank God my work was only five minutes away the way I drove, and Andrew was still breathing when I got there. 

Once my child was stabilized and here at Wolfson's, I began looking into the issue. It turns out that this is a known issue with Pixel phones. Other users have experienced technical glitches preventing them from calling 911 during a life or death crisis. Google knows this, did not release an alert or statement upon learning about it, eventually released an update that allegedly fixed the issue in older pixel phones, but not 6 or 6 pro, which I just purchased. Users of these phones may find themselves or their loved ones dead because Google, the largest tech company on the planet, can't seem to fix this issue and doesn't have the moral backbone to pull the phones from market until they do, or at the very least make current users aware that they may be not be able to contact emergency services when needed - the absolutely most vital function of any phone.

GooglePixel,Amazing Pixel 3 with Disco light,
GooglePixel,How to use OG Pixel as an unlimited Google Photos uploader.,"I had my old Pixel lying around doing nothing, so I decided to take advantage of the unlimited original quality Google Photos uploads for life, rather than having to be limited by High Quality on my Pixel 5, or pay ongoing subscription costs.

Firstly I factory reset it, then signed in and made sure Google Photos was set to upload in Original Quality. I installed Solid Explorer, which I'd previously bought the full version of. Then I used the FTP server function so I could connect to the DCIM folder remotely.

On my Pixel 5, I disabled Google Photos backup, and installed FolderSync. I created a folder pair to connect DCIM on the P5 to DCIM on the P1 via the FTP server. I set it to sync every six hours if I'm on my home WiFi, and delete the local copies when the sync succeeded (i.e. move rather than copy). Finally I set up a home screen widget on the P5 to initiate the sync manually.

The P1 stays plugged in and the FTP server is always available, so I can take endless photos and shoot 4k video on the P5, and let it sync on a regular basis, also clearing space. The P1 is set to Smart Storage to automatically remove local copies of backed up photos and videos, so as not to run out of space. To test it, I've kicked off a sync and a couple of minutes later, my P5 DCIM folder is empty (checked with Solid Explorer), the files are all on the P1 (again checked with SE) and they're all backed up to Google Photos (checked with the Google Photos web interface in Chrome).

Edited to add:

You'll also need to make sure your Pixel 1 is set to a static IP in your router's settings so that the FTP details don't change.

Using the power button enabled me to only have to use one hand to both hold the power button down, and press the screenshot button on the screen it pulled up.

GooglePixel,#BestPhonesForever: new Pixel ads... featuring iPhone,
GooglePixel,I think Google is starting to understand hardware,"I know it is a bit early and we need to look at the next 12 months before we can conclude this. I do however feel that the 4a is a product launch from someone who actually understands hardware. Some of the problems Google has had over the years (and frankly continues to be plagued with) are as follows:

1. Overpricing. I think we can all agree with this

2. Trying to immitate Apple in the wrong things - price, storage options, etc, while not making an attempt at emulating good aspects like excellent customer service and products that are well tested and without flaws (eg pixel 2 screen issues)

3. Distribution issues

4. Lack of availability outside USA and EU. 

5. Quality control issues


The 4a launch does not guarantee that the device or distribution will be flawless, far from it in fact. However, the one thing they have absolutely nailed is having a single SKU. This may sound like a mundane silly thing, however it offers a lot of benefits:

1. Distribution. No sending out x number of units for 64gb black and y number for 128gb white, and then playing Russian roulette with customer demand. They need to be stocked in just one SKU.

2. The customer knows what they want. If they are convinced to buy a 4a, there is no further decision to make about color and storage size. You do not risk losing a sale because a customer decides they want 'Ooh la la Green' but it is out of stock. 

3. It is easier to ensure world wide availability - again related to lower distribution costs 

4. Production is much easier - place one order for the device rather than 6 for 3 colors in 2 storage sizes. 

5. After sales service becomes a lot easier - broken device? Here's a replacement. No fiddling with colors / storage. Repairs should be easier too as shops need to source parts for one device.  

Besides the above, I think the device is very well priced, and Google have a real chance to get the Pixel name engrained into people's minds. The excellent camera should help as well."
GooglePixel,How reliant are you on the Pixel fingerprint scanner? Is the absence of it on the 4 a deal breaker for you?,"I use the fingerprint scanner at least 100x a day, not just to unlock but to authenticate my password manager, login to secure apps, approve purchases in Google Play Store, etc. 

Matter of fact, every app that accepts login with fingerprint, I have it turned on.  It's ESSENTIAL to my speedy workflow and very ergonomically placed.  Always right there an inch away from my finger, and the haptic feedback is also very comforting when it accepts.  It was a game changer for me when I first got the Pixel 2.

So, rumor has it Google will be using face recognition to unlock.  Not only do I not trust the security of it but I don't want to have to hold my phone up in selfie mode every time I need to authenticate, if this is even an option.   And what if I don't want to authenticate something I launched by mistake - do I have to quickly cover my face??  

I'm so disappointed there will be no scanner on the Pixel 4. I can't imagine any other biometric being as easy and useful.  It's probably a deal breaker for me.

How about you?  Thoughts advice and sarcastic jabs welcome!"
GooglePixel,Google still thinks 3 years of updates provide a 'great experience' ahead of cutting off Pixel 3,
GooglePixel,[OPINION] Fingerprint readers are better on the back,"So the current rumors are stating that the Pixel 4 will have a fingerprint sensor underneath the glass like the S10. But while this tech is cool, I think this is a mistake. I love how comfortable it is to slide my phone out of my pocket and already have it unlocked because my finger naturally rests on the back without even having to look at the phone. Not to mention, you lose the gesture to pull down the notification tray! So yeah, I think front facing readers suck, but what do you guys think?

Edit: Wow! This thread blew up over night. Thanks for keeping it civil, guys. I think facial recognition + rear fingerprint scanner is the best."

GooglePixel,UPDATE: Google Permanently banned my account because their system didn't recognize that I returned my phones to them,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/) a few months ago. It details how Google banned my payments account because I returned some RMA pixel phones to them and their system didn't recognize the return. When I did a credit card charge back, they banned me. There was no appeal process

Luckily, the post got enough traction that /u/PixelCommunity manager reached out to me. He looked at my case files and agreed I was banned in error, and reversed the ban. He said Google was aware that some phone returns were not processing in the system properly. [\(Link to comment\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/ds51hy6/?context=3) 

Update to today, two things happened.

(1) Google's Dispute department is still fighting my charge back claim with me and my credit card. I've sent in all the tracking numbers, RMA numbers, and have had to explain the issue in writing a few times. 

(2) This evening, I got an email saying my payments account is banned (again) because of a charge back and possible 'fraud'. I did not do any other charge backs, the ban is because of the same charge back from before. I can't make purchases, use android pay, google books, music, youtube red. I still have a gift card balance that I can't get back. 

To be honest, I'm really tired of dealing with this. I kept (and paid for) ONE Pixel 2XL. I tried with many, many calls last time and I couldn't get the ban reversed myself. At this point, maybe I should just make a brand new account, using the old one for email only (I still have email and photos unlocked). This has been going on since December. I just hope I win the credit card dispute soon so I can quit worrying about this.

edit: this kinda blew up... see a couple things. phone was in my front pocket and the other side had my wallet and keys kept my hands on my pocket for most of the night and double checking it was in there.

I did buy the preferred care not sure if that's the same as the protection thing most people are saying. also used the Google synchrony finance thing. should have just used my capital one card. basically out 1000$ and still have to pay it without having the phone.

also I did try to use the find my phone for about 3 hours just refreshing... long night... ended up doing that secure phone option and did the erase my data. have all my work stuff on there and have my gpay card. also I do have fingerprint on and pin with 2fa on.

Second update... 11-01. went to lost and found just to get peace of mind... nothing... phone was fully charged so no reason for it to be off... obviously someone turned it off. checking find my phone still. changed my passwords to everything i own. paranoid as fuck thinking someone is on my account. someone suggested to ask a credit card company.... I actually bought the phone through the google finance store. but my plan is under my Dads Family Plan. he uses BofA Credit Card. he is a preferred member as well. so i guess they said since he pays the phone bill with his credit card and my phone is under that Plan that i have to file a claim and they will see if they can help. worth a shot. but if not just gonna pay the minimum every month and get another one... might just go to best buy and buy the 128gb... i had the 256gb. so 2000$ for a lesser version of the one i had....

Or actually talk about how they like them. My p6 has been great. FPS flawless from day one. How fast does it charge? Don't care. I charge it when I'm asleep. What a concept. The battery lasts me all day and I don't use adaptive. A12 is what it is. It's give and take. I use Nova and it works great. I don't have a phobia about large clock numbers. The only thing I had a problem with was Assistant ghost dialing people and that has gotten better. I'm far from a pixel fanboy.  This is my first one after over a decade of iOS. I have used some Android tablets over the years though. I have yet to encounter another pixel owner out in the wild but I'm interested to see if it's as widespread as it is in these subs.

GooglePixel,Pixel 5 is $699 in the US because of mmWave.,I'm not saying blame Verizon on the $699 Pixel 5 price but i'm pretty sure it's that much because they require mmWave in there phones. The Verizon 4a 5G is $599. [https://www.verizon.com/about/news/pixel-preorders](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/pixel-preorders) $100 more just for mmWave. Some international Pixel 5's don't have mmWave so that explains why some of them are about $100 less then the US model. They should have launched a non-mmWave model for $599 in the US.

I did this because I saw people complaining about permanent damage basically out of the box, and I didn't believe it. So now we see that these scratches are cosmetic and literally take no effort whatsoever to wipe away. They are NOT permanent scratching to the ""inferior glass backing"" where Gorilla Glass 5 or whatever would fix, they're not permanent at all.

I thought the metals had worn out and stopped gripping as strongly as they used to. Then, I decided to clean out the USB port. Holy hell. There was so much lint, and it completely fixed the issue for me.

Edit: The best way to do this is by using the toothpick end of a plastic flosser, which are thin enough to fit and won't damage anything. Remember to scratch on the outer part of the connector and trying to be careful with the strip in the middle (as that's where the data pins are). You want to focus on the bottom of the port, as that's where most of the lint will be, and it will probably be tightly packed, which is why compressed air may not help."
GooglePixel,Pixel 5 impressions after a week coming from a Pixel 2,"Things I like about the Pixel 5 which it has in common with the Pixel 2

* The relatively compact size, so I can easily carry it in a pocket or use it with one hand.
* The metal back with a slightly rough plasticised coating, which I think is a much underrated feature.
* The fingerprint sensor on the back. Why would you put it anywhere else?
* Stock, or nearly stock, Android. I don’t want to have to deal with Samsung software.
* Water resistance.
* I haven’t been able to test out the camera much, but the camera on the Pixel 2 was really good and if the camera on the Pixel 5 is at least as good, and every indication is that it is, I will be happy. The Pixel 5 adds a wide angle lens of course.

Standout features of the Pixel 5

* It’s full of screen. The bezels are impressively thin and symmetrical. The punch hole camera on the front is not obnoxious, hides in the status bar and doesn’t interfere with videos. The high refresh rate is nice to have.
* It’s full of battery. Working from home and using a dark theme, I’ve been getting about two days from it.

Other comments

* Wireless charging is nice to have. I’ve bought myself an Anker 15W charger (the phone itself charges wirelessly at a maximum of 12W).
* The Pixel 2 was fast enough for my needs, so the Pixel 5 is more than fast enough. 8Gb of RAM is nice to have I suppose.
* The Pixel 5 should get three years of updates, whereas the Pixel 2 is coming to the end of support.
* I’ve not been able to test 5G yet.

Minor quibbles

* The fingerprint sensor isn’t very recessed.
* Squeeze to assist is gone.
* The top under-screen speaker is a bit tinny.
* The haptics feel a bit unrefined.
* ~~The Pixel 5 is not yet Android Enterprise certified, which means I still have to use my old phone for work email.~~ Edit: as of 29 Oct 20, the Pixel 5 is now Android Enterprise certified, so I can access my work email.

In short, the upgrade was worth it to me, I hope this is useful.

I get that there might be supply-chain disruptions at the moment, but that hasn't been the issue in the past when you've chosen to make your non-US customers a far lower priority for hardware launches. Based on similar launches, it seems like your model is to supply the US first, then make stock available elsewhere as US demand slows, or you get a better sense of how the product is landing.

I'm a huge fan of giving people the option to choose between gesture and normal navigation, but I hope Google doesn't try to force everyone to use gestures. Sadly, it seems a lot of the more recent Android changes have been all about removing the ability to choose and customize...

Why would I ever want to have to make a sweeping gesture to do something when I can make a simple tap? The back button is a beautiful thing, and I absolutely hate using phones without it (most of my family are a bunch of quitters and have iPhones). Even if I'm in the minority, I'm sure that--at the very least--people with arthritis would agree. "

GooglePixel,Disappointed in the size of the Pixel 6?,"Who else is disappointed that the smaller pixel 6 will feature a 6.4"" display and a sizeable jump from the pixel 5 (and really, all other ""regular"" pixels) before? I realize this isn't the first time this had been discussed, but figured to see where everyone's heads are at. I realize many in the pixel world these days prefer the larger devices anyway.

Don't get me wrong, i really like what the company is doing with the tech itself, i just don't understand why we have to have such a large base model. The smaller form factor has been a key motivator for me in pixels for so long and i just can't hide my disappointment when it goes away. It's been nice to not get handcuffed features in a smaller device like others have done, and to have the other of the ""a* variants if we wanted to.

Anyway, trying to still see the positives here, which is that this is shaping up to be a really dope overall device that I'll almost definitely be preordering. But losing the telephoto upgrade and still having a significantly larger device than before... It's hitting me in the feels right now. I don't want to buy bigger pockets..."
GooglePixel,Has anyone else noticed any battery drain since the June update?,
GooglePixel,No chargers in box is idiotic idea to save money,"First lets be honest everyone who is doing this, is doing this to save money. They're not gonna sell for 10 € cheaper because you have no charger. And long term chargers might even become more expensive. Now what's gonna happen is more and more people will start using different chargers from different brands and it's gonna have negative impact on battery, battery charging speed...

But hey you can always spend extra money and buy charger. Just like 100 € wireless headphones for your no headphone jack phone, this is another way for these companies to drain your wallet.

Hello,

You may remember me from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ir1qne/just_fyi_i_was_able_to_warranty_rma_my_pixel_buds/) in which I said it had been ""hassle-free"" to warranty my defective Pixel Buds.

Lol no.

I sent the Pixel Buds back at the beginning of September. After 3 weeks went by without getting my money back, I started sending an email once per week to request an update on the status of the refund. All of these were ignored.

I reached out to Pixel Buds support via chat to find out why. Rep Harry told me that they had received my Pixel Buds, but could not return my money. When I asked how that wasn't just stealing, he disconnected.

I started another chat with Ivan, who said Harry was just incompetent and didn't know what he was talking about. My refund would be forthcoming. I asked him to confirm this in an email to me because I wanted it in writing. He wouldn't go that far, no matter how much I insisted, but he did send me an RMA number and told me the refund request was still active.

I have been communicating ever since with both Ivan and Harry via email, each of whom tells me different things. Now there's a Kylie involved too. All promise to consult with ""specialists"" to figure out how best to resolve this issue. It seems pretty straight-forward to me: I have returned my defective Pixel Buds, and now you return my money.

/u/PixelCommunity, if you still monitor this subreddit, this has been a truly deranged Kafkaesque nightmare of a customer service experience, ranking below even my past dealings with Comcast.

I've bought two Pixel phones and had planned to buy more in the future. Why is Google treating me like such a sack of garbage?


**EDIT:** Pitchforks down! My money has been returned!

I just scrolled through my bank account transaction history to find that my money was returned on Oct. 22.
Now, I certainly feel like an idiot, BUT in my defense:

I received NO notification through Google Pay or from anyone at Google that my refund had been processed.
The customer service chats I had with Harry and Ivan, in which I was told, first, that my money *could not* be returned, and then, second, that it *would* be returned, took place on **Oct. 26.**

In all of the emails I have exchanged with them since then, my RMA status has been referred to as ""active."" There is no record of the money being returned in my Google Pay account. I had to find it scrolling through my bank app.

I still feel foolish and am sorry for riling you all up, but this remains, in my opinion, a colossal customer service failure. Thanks /u/dmziggy for your willingness to help. I'll respond below and to your ticket to let you know to abort the escalation process.

GooglePixel,My experience so far with the Pixel 5 coming from a Pixel 3,"I haven't even had the phone for 24 hours yet so keep that in mind - these are very early impressions! Just thought I'd compare directly with my Pixel 3 whilst I still can, as I'll probably be trading the older phone in this weekend.

Let's get this out of the way first. The bad:

* Speakers are not as good as Pixel 3's front firers. They're tinnier, less punchy, and the stereo effect is more imbalanced towards the bottom speaker when holding the phone in landscape. They're serviceable for casual YouTubing and phonecalls/podcasts but don't try and seriously play music on them. No crackle or distortion but just a notable downgrade vs Pixel 3. So far this is definitely the phone's Achilles heel.

* Photos take a little longer (by a second or two) to process vs Pixel 3 due to no dedicated visual core. Not a huge difference by any means, but it's there.

* Black smearing is still here at low brightness levels, albeit not as bad as on Pixel 3.


Now for the more encouraging part! The good:

* Display is a **monumental** upgrade over Pixel 3. I'll prove it - see [Pixel 3 here](https://i.imgur.com/jC6wMTo.jpg), and then [Pixel 5 here](https://i.imgur.com/OmCs8cs.jpg). Both phones were locked to 25% brightness. They both had the exact same image on the display (ignore the purple tint on the Pixel 5, that was just the camera struggling with the very low light conditions). You can't see anything in the Pixel 3 photo because it doesn't display the grey squares at all at that brightness level, everything is crushed into black nothingness. I have to crank Pixel 3 brightness to 35% to match Pixel 5's display at 0% to get the grey squares to the same level of visibility on both screens - that's a huge improvement for the new phone! ([Here's the link to the image with grey squares if you want to test it out on your phone](https://i.imgur.com/bWPsANV.jpg)).

* Performance seems smooth so far, navigating the UI is nice and fluent, animations look fluid. Apps launch quickly, phone feels snappy so far. I've logged into all the usual apps I had on Pixel 3 including known resource hogs (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Amazon for example). 90Hz provides a noticeable boost to scrolling vs 60Hz. Pixel 5 definitely keeps many more apps in memory than Pixel 3.

* The aesthetic of the small, symmetrical bezels is really good! [Looks much more 'modern' than my Pixel 3.](https://i.imgur.com/FIfpXSf.jpg) Quite the stunner.

* Battery life so far seems to be much better than Pixel 3 - I can't say that much yet because obviously it's very early days, haven't got a full day from it yet. But I can already see it drains much less per hour than the Pixel 3 in active use. Standby also seems better so far - 0% drain overnight (with no AOD).

* Call quality is fine. I tested it with my brother. He sounded a bit more 'distant' than with my Pixel 3 but I could still make out his every word clearly (and my mum making random comments in the background from time to time haha). He did say that I sounded much better on his end vs my Pixel 3 (everyone has always complained about the quality of my voice from my Pixel 3 microphones).

* Haptics are a bit better than Pixel 3. Tighter, more refined. If that makes sense? More precise, like iPhone haptics and less coarse rattling of the whole phone. It's hard to put into words. I prefer Pixel 5 haptics, that's what I'm saying.

* Video is better on Pixel 5. 4K 60fps video is definitely nicer looking than Pixel 3's 4K 30fps. Haven't had much opportunity to properly test it out yet though. Same story story with ultrawide lens - looks fine at first impressions, haven't had opportunity to test it thoroughly yet though. Need more time to assess these new features.

* Main sensor photos appear fine. Not much different from Pixel 3 to be honest, I can see a bit more detail when zooming into an image and the slightly wider aperture seems to help to capture a bit more light in dark indoor conditions. It's not a big difference though, I imagine most of these improvements were applicable to last year's Pixel 4 too. But still, it's the same great camera experience as always. [Here's a completely unedited photo of my fish that wouldn't stay still.](https://i.imgur.com/y559ZYk.jpg)

* The fabric case is quite nice honestly. Nice grippy texture. Green Chameleon colour really melds well with the Sage model!

That's probably enough for now (this has already evolved into a wall of text, oops). Overall, I am liking what I'm seeing so far. I'll of course keep sharing my findings as I use the phone more. Any questions I'll answer to the best of my ability.

Hope this proves interesting to someone out there! 🙂"

GooglePixel,Am I the only one who wants a small Pixel?,"After my Pixel 5 bricked I switched to the 6a and while I enjoy Pixel smartphones a lot in general (besides their terrible customer service), they’re just too big and uncomfortable for my liking… and the Pixel 8 looks to be the more or less the same size as the 6a. I recently bought an iPhone 13 Mini as a secondary phone as it’s literally the only small ""flagship“ device available today. I love the size (I think it’s 5.4 inches compared to the 6 inches of the Pixel 5), it’s literally perfect. Battery life is for my usage with 4h-5h SOT more than enough considering its size, I don’t want to spend more time on my phone during a day anyway. However, an iPhone could never become my primary device for multiple reasons (no hate) and I sincerely wish Google would make a Pixel with the same (or similar) size. Am I alone or are we just such a tiny minority? What do you think will the future for smaller Pixel or Android phones look like? Shout out to everyone whose Pixel 5 is still going strong! Best Pixel ever (imo)

Edit: Thanks for all the thoughts! Asus Zenfone is unfortunately not available at my carrier in Germany, only Samsung, Apple, Google, Sony and Xiaomi as far as I remember. The 2 years support would be a deal breaker to me as well since I want to keep my phone for more than two years and still enjoy a few new things. Anyway, hope everyone enjoys their device and thanks for sharing your sentiments!"

GooglePixel,"I feel like Google has ruined my phone (original Pixel) with each additional ""update"". Warning: Rant","I'm frustrated with Google. In fact, I'm not sure I will ever buy another Google phone after my experience with my current Pixel 1.

I realize my phone is several years old. Google was kind enough to remind me of that when I submitted a help request. Fuck me for wanting to hold onto a phone I spent several hundred dollars on for a couple of years, I know.

The pixel started off as a great phone. Snappy, took good pictures, I enjoyed its seamless integration with backing up photo's to Google's cloud, the fingerprint sensor was nearly flawless, good form factor, etc.

Last year, I noticed I was starting to miss a lot of calls. I figured I was just being inattentive, or forgetting to turn on my ringer. After several months/maybe a year of thinking I was crazy, I definitively noticed one day that my phone was on full volume and I missed a call while my phone was <1 ft from me. I googled it and what do you know, a lot of people complaining that a recent update left them with seemingly random loss of ringing when receiving a call. Such a basic, fundamental aspect of the phone, now called into question.

And then today I had the most frustrating bug I have ever experienced. TWO alarms set on my phone, neither of which went off. I double-checked everything - alarm volume is up, alarms were actively set and for the proper day, AM and not PM, etc. No missed alarm notificaiton. Everything is right. I google it, and what do you know.. other people complaining of the same thing.

This is such basic shit to work on a phone, and yet when I emailed Google inquiring about a fix, the first thing the rep says to me is... the Pixel is X years old and the current Pixel 3 would be a great upgrade. Gee, thanks, I would love to spend $800 on a new phone to make sure it rings when someone calls me.

Anyway, I just felt the need to rant. I'm annoyed that such basic functions of a phone are now being called into question due to 'updates' over the years. What good is a phone if it doesn't friggen RING when someone calls? And thank you, Google, for that extremely helpful suggestion to fix the problem by sending you more money. Always a useful recommendation indeed.


******************************************************

Edit - this blew up more than I thought it would. Some things to add/worth pointing out

1) I have done a factory reset of the phone. Didn't help, unfortunately.

2) Interesting to note how many people are commenting below about how they're also missing calls and never noticed. How very interesting indeed.... which leads me into my third point

3) The few (very few, fortunately) people who have aggressively called me out for making this up, pretending there are no issues, demanding my app list and then getting upset I didn't respond an hour later.. First of all, I don't care if you're a google fanboi and are upset by this post. In fact, I'm laughing at you because I find it hilarious someone feels the need to defend Google or any phone manufacturer. Secondly, read this thread and see how many other people are suddenly realize they're missing calls as well. I guess we're all just fucking up our phones with candy crush! But I digress.

4) When I miss a call, I've noticed the phone is still receiving the call, but the screen doesn't really turn on and it doesn't ring. So, I don't think it's a network issue for that reason."

I can't believe I'm writing that Apple has better pricing for anything tech related, but Apple lets you upgrade from 64gb to 128gb for $50 and from 64gb to 256gb for $150 on the iPhone XR. Pricing is similar for the iPhone XS, upgrading from 64gb to 256 is $150 and for 64gb to 512gb is $350.

I understand that microsd cards aren't the same as soldered storage, but I believe the point is still valid."

GooglePixel,Android 10s dark mode is still half-baked,"There is still a bunch of native Google apps that just don't go dark when turning on dark mode. I feel like that should be the least they need to be able to pull off (using a Pixel 3 XL btw).

Specifically, these native apps don't (automatically) go dark for me:
* messages
* app store
* keyboard (super frustrating)
* Gmail
* YouTube
* Google Maps
* Translate
* Podcasts
* Play Music

Two more thoughts:
1. In many apps, it's _way_ too complicated to actually get to the dark mode setting. It should be a simple switch on the first options level.
2. Hardly any third-party apps manage to pull of the transition. Reddit, for instance, does. There should be so many more. I mean, how hard can it possibly be!? Apple manages to do it so I feel like at least the Pixel lineup should as well."
GooglePixel,"Have had my Pixel 3a XL for less than 24 hours, Here's some Surprises and Thoughts","\- Build does not feel cheap at all. Feels very similar to the Pixel 2 XL Panda feel. Feels well built. Back has that frosted feeling to it. 

\- OLED screen is really good for a sub $500 phone

\- Stereo Speakers are really good. I like them better than the Pixel 3 XL's. Might not get quite as loud but sound very clear and not as much vibration as the 3XL's. These don't feel like budget speakers.

\- Haptic Feedback is great. I was expecting cheap feeling haptics, maybe tinny feeling but this feels very similar to the 3XL. Came from a Note 9 and its as good or better feeling that the note 9.

\- Size is perfect. Note 9 was too tall for me. 

\- Weight, its lighter but not cheap feeling. With a old 3XL case on it(fits pretty close until I get a proper case) it has the right weight. 

\- Headphone Jack audio sounds very good, similar to the Note 9. Not an audiophile tho so don't quote me but its sounds like the same quality other flagships have.

\- Phone feels fast. Might open apps a little slower than a flagship but its not ""as slow as crap"" like some are saying. I'm sure its not as fast at gaming but its definitely fast for my use case(music, YT, Social Media, Reddit, Chrome, etc)

\- Camera, Awesome, not slow at capturing(HDR processing in the background is a little slower but not really slow or much different). So glad to have a Pixel camera again, the Note 9 is nice and all but taking photos of moving subjects and in lower light conditions is not its best features. 

\- Battery Life, so far hard to tell but seems as good as the note 9 or in between it and the Pixel 3 XL.

\- Buttons, feel well made and durable. Nice clicky buttons. 

\- fingerprint Scanner is great.

I am very happy with this phone. I'm really kinda single handedly blown away by how much google fit in this package. They really only skimped on the processor which seems great for my needs to far. I think people are bashing this phone too much when they have no experience actually using it yet. Yes its missing features but things needed cut for the price, and yes I understand you can get some flagships discounted close to this price but this phone is wonderful. I wholeheartedly recommend it so far. I was really on the fence yesterday driving to Best Buy. I was thinking I would regret it. But its the opposite. I'm so glad I did. The Note 9 is wonderful and everything but it just has too many features that get in its own way. Plus I just wanted the best camera on a smartphone and that's the Pixel 3a/3/3xl. Price is such a great value especially at $479 + $100 bonus bringing it to $379.

At my University, there were some students (at least they looked like students) who were using what definitely looked like Pixel 4 XLs to get facial identification from passing students to send back to, you guessed it--Google!

As a Google fanatic and being in this subreddit, seeing the square cutout camera bump was a shock and I had to check out what was going on. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but the guy declined to answer anything pertaining the device itself. I also asked to take pictures, but he said that he ""preferred I not"" so bummer. He did tell me that he was commissioned by Google but not directly working for them and was told to give out $5 Starbucks gift cards to entice people to scan their faces to send to Google for Face ID (whatever it'll be called) improvements.

* The device looks exactly like the leaks confirmed. Noticeable top band but pretty tiny chin, the phone was enclosed in this metallic cage that only really let out the bottom with a bottom firing speaker(s?) and the back camera bump that had two cameras, a flash at the bottom, and a small cutout on the top probably for the laser autofocus. It was also a black bumper with a white backing, so panda 4/XL is confirmed for sure!
* The process for scanning was different from the leaks that we've seen. It was no cute little head animation, it showed a bunch of dots that he asked me to follow with my nose in a rotational pattern. Honestly, I was in shock that I was even holding the damn thing so I did a sloppy job but he didn't really seem to mind. Then, he asked me to put it to my side, like how you hold your phone casually while walking, and then brought it back up to my face and asked me to tap the volume key, which was where my thumb naturally rested. I do have bigger than normal hands, so I'm not sure how this will pan out for your perspectives. This bringing down to the side and back up went on for a few times, each time something different. He asked me to cover my left eye, right eye, then nose with my hand, and the last time asked me to just close my left eye, then right, then both.

\- - - - -

Even though I couldn't access anything other than that specific settings screen, there were some things I wanted to test out.

\- - - - - 

* 90 hertz screen didn't seem to be on because side by side with my Pixel 3 there wasn't any difference, but I assume this is a setting that we have to manually change ourselves.
* Haptic feedback was actually pretty odd. It isn't as prominent as in the Pixel 3/3 XL, but it still felt firm. A much gentler haptic feedback but improvements nonetheless. I felt the Pixel 3's haptic feedback could get a little wonky at times.
* Screen quality looked really nice. It was a white background and I inspected the phone for any blue tint, put it in direct sunlight and it was still bright and visible. I could barely see the cutouts for flood illuminator/IR cameras, but the soli chip is quite visible in direct sunlight at the top right. Speaker earpiece is also considerably smaller as well. Something else to note is the dynamic range was pretty good for the front facing camera, which I HEAVILY inspected while scanning my acne covered face.

That pretty much concludes my 5 minutes with what I can confidently say was the Pixel 4 XL. I nerded out so hard and the guy was trying really hard not to say anything about it but he could tell that I definitely knew wassup. Please feel free to ask any other questions; I'd be happy to try to answer them! I know we already have videos and leaks, but I'm a nobody on the internet who actually got to hold one without jumping through hoops and it excites me that I can actually contribute to the Pixel 4 leak squad 🥰

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the navigation bar was the 3 button layout.

GooglePixel,Pixel 5 allegedly has 8gb of ram,
GooglePixel,"Another Thanksgiving, another year of spending 20 minutes figuring out how to give and get photos from relatives with iPhones","I'm so annoyed as per usual with sharing photos between iPhones and my Pixel. Family members spent all day taking photos of us cooking, the kids playing football, and all other kinds of fun. But I won't get access to any of those because I'm not part of the iMessage text chain that they all share. 

I posed with a few family members for a photo and it was taken with an iPhone 13. I then asked if we could also take it on my phone so I didn't have to deal with trying to get the photo in full quality. ""Oh wow,"" they say, looking at my photo, ""yours is so much warmer and looks a lot better.""

Thank you. I know. It's why I bought my Pixel 3. 

I also took a selfie at the dinner table, with my wide angle selfie lens. It took 10 minutes of working with my tech-savvy cousin to figure out how to download the photo from a Google Photos link onto their iPhone. They asked me to text it to them but I refused because I knew it would compress it to oblivion through SMS, prompting more ""you have an Android"" comments.

An hour later after after the photo was downloaded through Google Photos and my cousin forwarded it to the family iMessage chat, I got lots of compliments about the photo. Mostly surprised at how good the quality was, but also thankful that my selfie was able to get all of the food and people in one shot. ""You did a good job with this photo!"" and ""Oh wow your Android photo isn't pixelated! Wow!""

Thank you. I know. It's why I bought my Pixel 3. 

On top of all of that, I know this could be easily fixed by Apple implementing RCS into it's iMessage app. Then I could just text everyone the photos at full resolution. Better yet, I could even be a part of the group chat. But Apple refuses to play fair. 

Whatever. I'm just annoyed. Three years ago, I bought my phone for half the price of an iPhone, and it still consistently takes shots that are competitive with, and often even better than, the iPhone 13. 

And I'm still suck at family gatherings trying to share photos. 

TL;DR: Thanksgiving was fun but it's still ridiculously complicated to share my high-quality Pixel 3 photos with my relatives. After figuring out how to do so, they complimented me on my photos.

Edit: wording for clarity.

Edit 2: thank you for all your suggestions. Sending a Google Photos link works great for Android but downloading them on iOS is complicated. If you hit Download All, it downloads a zip file (""what is a ZIP file?""). After that, they need to go into the files app and click unzip, and then they need to import to camera roll for some reason (even though the photos are already on the phone?!). Also, for whatever reason, my cousin tried to download the photos both individually and as a zip on their phone. It just led to a blank white screen. So... It's a process, trying to get people on iOS to download from a Google Photos link. And that doesn't even consider trying to get photos from them."

GooglePixel,Had an emergency - Pixel 6a would not dial 000.," 4 Week old Pixel 6a.  


Just found an unresponsive man passed out next to his vehicle.  


When I tried to dial 000 the phone displayed my location and did nothing else, there was no ringtone and it never connected to emergency services (see screenshot). I had to run 2 minutes down the road to find help from someone with a functioning phone.  
The time I spent looking for someone instead of performing CPR may of contributed to this mans passing.   


In all honesty this is absolutely shocking, at bare minimum a phone should be able to dial for emergency services. Even testing now I get the same issue. This is really scary! If this had been someone I cared about I would be absolutely beside myself and would never forgive Google. This bug needs to be brought to public attention right now and resolved ASAP!"
GooglePixel,Google Assistant making reservations on Pixel is now active! I tried it.,"I used the Google Assistant option on Google maps to get a reservation at a BBQ joint. Here's what happened. (Pixel 3 on Android 10. USA)

- It warned me the location wasn't open yet, but it will try anyway. 
- It reported back the location didn't answer and it will try when they open. 
- Exactly at opening time it called and tried to get me a reservation, reporting back the location didn't take reservations. This also removed the option on Google maps with a note (this location doesn't accept reservations).

Here's what is cool.
I spoke to workers when I arrived asking who took the call from the guy who asked for a reservation for two at opening time. The owner said she took the call. I told her that was not a person, but my Google Assistant. She laughed and didn't believe me. Then I explained further. She swore she was talking to a real person.

In case you didn't know, Max Weinbach is a pretty reliable leaker, with a good track-record, trusted by multiple people in the industry, such as 9to5google. Though it's important to keep in mind that these are still not 100% confirmed, especially since they are not from tweets or articles, but a conversation in a podcast.

So here are every new juicy things Max said:

\-25:50 Pixel 5a will be more expensive than Pixel 4a (that was probably to be expected since it's basically a 4a 5G from what we've seen from previous leaks).

\-13:10 Pixel Watch to be powered by 5 nm Samsung chip, not Qualcomm.

\-16:40 Pixel Watch and Pixel 6 to launch in October, except if there's chip shortage which would result in a November launch.

\-17:20 Pixel 6 SoC (Whitechapel) is ""an in-between 888 and 865"".

\-22:50 The main reason why Google will use Whitechapel instead of a Qualcomm SoC:

>AI, they can do their own custom NPUs. The ISP in there is custom-designed. Their camera sensors are custom top of the line sensors.

\-23:50 Bigger Pixel 6 would be 120Hz QHD with 5000 mAh.

\-23:50 Smaller Pixel 6 would be 120Hz FHD and it seems he was less certain about that but assumed around 4500 mAh.

\-39:00 One Pixel 6 color scheme is constituted of a peach color at the top and a sand color (like the Not Pink of the Pixel 3) at the bottom with a gold body.

\-39:20 There will be a green Pixel 6 (he doesn't know what the specific colors are).

\-41:40 Pixel 6 marketing budget on the level of a Samsung Galaxy S-series device. Google is willing to spend money on this phone.

\-43:10 The camera design in the form of a bar that we've seen is going to be the design language of future Pixel phones because it's a future-proof design thanks to all the room it gives to allow new camera tech.

I've tried other Android manufacturers over the years and have always been let down by their skinned OS/update timeliness, which has always lead me to be loyal to the Nexus/Pixel line for 8+ years (currently own a Pixel 3).

But the Pixel 4 was a let down and now what's shaping up to be the Pixel 5 also looks pretty weak (for the rumored price).

For the first time ever, I'm considering an iPhone which I thought I'd never do. Is anyone else feeling the same?

EDIT: I want to clarify, I love Android and *if* I end up switching there will definitely be things I will miss. But I'm tired of being a ""beta-tester"" for Google. I was fine when it was the Nexus line and things didn't work sometimes (both hardware and software) because it was positioned and priced for developers to tinker. **But the whole point of introducing the Pixel line was to be a competitive, consumer-ready flagship.** It was supposed to be the ""north star"" for all other Android manufacturers and an example of what a premium flagship Android device could be.

The first Pixel felt like that. But with every release since it feels it's slipping back to what the Nexus line was. Not that the Nexus line was bad, but it was positioned for a different purpose. And it makes it hard for consumers that want a premium, stock (e.i. clean) Android experience to justify the price for a phone that **requires** tweaking, RMAing, and compromising. "

Since I don't have a second device to take pictures with anymore I took some shots in the mirror with my Spigen Liquid Crystal case on and off. I cleaned the outside of the case and phone pretty well but there's still some little pieces of lint floating around. The inside is perfectly clean if you choose not to use a case.

GooglePixel,Went from iPhone 14 Plus to Pixel 6a...just wow....,"I've always had Pixels in the past, even Nexuses before that. I was gifted an iPhone 14 plus so I started using that after my Pixel 5. But during the black Friday sales the pixel 6a dropped so low in price that I was able to exchange my pixel 5 for a pixel 6a by just adding a tiny bit on top. So I thought I'd take the pixel 6a out for a spin....

This phone is an absolute bargain. My iPhone 14plus is around 1k$ in price and there is very little I can't do on the 6a that I can on the iPhone. That 700USD price difference is ridiculous. The frame rate on paper is higher on the iPhone but it lags heavily, the pixel 6a is so smoooooth. Also the camera is just incredible for this price. The software makes up for the lower spec hardware and magic eraser is the cherry on top. Apple simply cannot justify that price tag

Edit: getting unnecessary hate from Apple users over this post. saying the budget pixel was smoother than the iPhone (in my experience) shouldn't enrage someone on Reddit to the extent that you're personally attacking me :)

Re-edit: my god people are so angry :D I'd like to apologise to the Reddit community and in particular iPhone users, I genuinely thought the iPhone 14 plus had a higher frame rate. Next time i post, I will check the facts better :) BUT...I still stand by the fact that the phone itself is smoother with an incredibly lower price tag."
GooglePixel,Can confirm via my own source that the Pixel 5 will use a Snapdragon 765. No phone with a top tier CPU from Google this year.,
GooglePixel,Confirmed: Pixel 6 / Pro massive battery drain due to software bug. Fix inside,"Due to the help of people over at xda, I manged to figure out two scenarios where a software bug will prevent the phone from ever going into deep sleep. I am posting this here because /r/GooglePixel seems to have changed into a territory for haters of rooting and custom ROMs/Kernel. How ever, without root you will probably never figure this out.

So here I am posting this for everyone who is facing massive battery drain (like I did):

**ProxyHandler gets stuck after a reboot**

Link: [https://support.google.com/pixelpho...oxycontroller-wakelock-draining-battery?hl=en](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/134103821/proxycontroller-wakelock-draining-battery?hl=en)

Basically every now and then the ""ProxyHandler"" will get stuck after a  reboot and prevent the phone from ever going into deep sleep.

Fix:

* To temporarily fix this go into airplane mode and reboot again.
* Disable  airplane mode after the reboot and use your phone until the next reboot

**When the screen gets stuck at 60Hz**

I wasn't able to figure out which service is keeping the device awake. But I did track down that the 60Hz stuck-issue is also prevent the phone to going into deep sleep.

Fix:

* Reboot the phone

&#x200B;

**Other notes regarding testing:**

In my testing it doesn't seem like ""Naptime"" will fix or help with any of the issues. Also in my testing it seems like ""Naptime"" in general doesn't do anything regarding battery drain / deep sleep.

Deep Sleep means that the phone will save a lot of battery while the screen is off. Usually the drain during deep sleep is 0,2-0,5%/h. Without deep sleep it is somewhere at 2-4%/h.

So far I have been using BBS to track down most of the issues.To use BBS on Android 12:

* Install BBS
* Grant all permissions
* Run in adb: adb shell settings put global hidden\_api\_policy 1
* Reboot phone
* Everything except kernel wakelocks will work

&#x200B;

Hope this helps some people."
GooglePixel,Perhaps my biggest annoyance with Android 12 is how expanding lock screen notifications draws down the entire notification tray,"I love Android 12. I love my Pixel 6. But viewing notifications on the lock screen is a chore. Expending any notification will expand the notification tray. The notifications cannot be collapsed. The tray cannot be collapsed. Can you side swipe the notification tray away? Nope. And sliding up the notification tray does not, as one would think, collapse the notification tray. Nope, it brings up the pin code number pad.

All of this just because I want to expand a notification on the lock screen. And you might ask why don't I just press the power button after I'm done viewing a notification to go back into sleep mode when I'm done. To that I say, why should I? Back in Android 11, I was able to expand notifications from the lock screen without the tray being pulled down, avoiding this new annoyance. That should come back.

Such a simple and time saving task shouldn't take me this long to get used to. And it sure as hell shouldn't be this inconvenient to use.

GooglePixel,Night Mode Astrophotography: Keep your expectations in check.,"Hey everyone,

I know a lot of people are being very critical at the moment. Some for good reason, some for not so good reasons. 

I think there is going to be a big wave of negativity when everyone starts trying out Astrophotography. I just want to let a lot of people understand that where you live may not work well for Astrophotography of any sort, let alone on the Pixel 4.

Light noise ruins astrophotography. If you can't see stars in your city, your photos aren't going to make them magically appear. You need to have a very dark sky.

If you can't see a lot of stars and don't barely see the milky way, they aren't going to show up in your photos most likely.

This is going to be a really awesome feature, but I just want to check everyone's expectations."

Thank you kind redditor for the platinum award, you guys have made my day, really appreciate it! :)"
GooglePixel,I've taken more photos in the last 3 months since switching to Pixel 3 than the last 4 years of owning iPhones,"~880 pictures so far on my Pixel 3. My previous two phones were iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 which I used for about 4 years total and totaled ~400 pictures each. 

What I think Google got right was reducing the inhibitions of pulling out the phone to take a photo. Compared to my iPhones, I feel like I don't need to be deliberate when taking photos with Pixel 3. Things like not having to worry about storing the photos, means I'm not wasting time deleting bad photos as I take them. Also not having to look at the screen to open the camera app allows me to ready the camera without missing the moment with my own eyes. Rather than pulling out the camera only on special occasions, the Pixel justifies taking more photos of my surroundings and experimenting. It's a better user experience. "
GooglePixel,Idea: Pixel phones plugged to a monitor should enable chrome os,"On the example of Samsung a few years ago, integrating android and chrome os would demonstrate Google's leading position. The two OS share already so much, including the apps. The phone could then become the webcam, the microphone and speaker.
Imagine the professional use: in a hot desk set-up, employees come in the morning and have their pixel phone in their pocket. They choose a work space and plug the phone to the usb-c stand. On the available monitor, chrome os enterprise is booting up. Fully agile."
GooglePixel,Active edge squeeze is a highly underrated feature,"I've been using this feature a lot more lately and while it's pretty simple on paper, it makes for much slicker voice command use compared to other phones. I never really thought about it until I used it to identify a song at a bar the other day and blew my friends minds.

My friends with Iphones: ""Hey Siri"" while half the time this shit doesn't trigger their voice search and they sound like derps repeating ""HeY SiRi! HeY SiRi!"" over and over until it does. 

Me: *subtly squeeze the side of my phone*... ""What song is this""? Voice search registers on first try and result returned in seconds

We lost power to our coop and could not use the plug in light that we use to check the eggs, so we improvised and tried the phone flashlight. It works better than the device made for the purpose! This phone continues to have new and surprising features all the time. Love it.

-Edit- Adding the requested [pic](https://imgur.com/k6d1aYe) of an egg being candled. This one is one that was developing (as you can see by the dark area and the veiny lines) but that was rejected by the hen. Our chickens are new to this and are learning how to hatch eggs as they go, so while sad, it happens. They'll get the hang of it eventually!"
GooglePixel,Finally left the walled garden,"Hi everyone, my first post here

I finally made the switch from iPhone (a XS) to a Pixel 7, after waiting all these years for a Pixel that would appeal to me as mature enough. Well, this was the year (and the apple products price hikes just helped make the decision).

I have been full on apple for a decade, starting from my beloved 4S, macbook pro (2014), ipads etc... But I honestly became more and more alienated from this company in the last 3-4 years from a number of factors, such as the money grab at every chance (it's always been a thing with them, but it's getting ridiculous), the decay in design quality/care (software AND hardware, IMO), the phone camera picture ""style"" direction, the whole app store ""closeness"" and developers' relationship, and on and on.

I realized I started ditching most of their services in favour of google or microsoft alternatives (and because of my job as well), so the jump it has been surprisingly smooth, and after the first day with this Pixel 7 I am totally in love with the device in a way I haven't long felt with a tech product.

Reading this sub has been a pleasant company during the wait for the delivery, and a motivator to believe in the good quality of this device, hope I will enjoy the ride ahead with you all.

P.s. sold my old apple watch, and waiting for the Pixel watch coming in a couple of weeks as well :)"
GooglePixel,The Pixel's photo quality is still better than the iPhone's,"I just got Pixel 4a 5G today. I traded in my old 3a to T-Mobile and got the new one for free. I also got the iPhone 12 Pro Max a few weeks back, it's my daily driver. I took a few sample comparison pics and it's pretty clear that the Pixel's camera is much better. 

The iPhone's colors look off and it still can't get portrait mode right. This couldn't be any more clear than when I tried taking pictures of my new puppy. He moves around all the time and it's rare for him to hold still for more than a few seconds. The iPhone struggles with shutter speed, especially in portrait mode. Pixel? Works like a charm. With that said, the iPhone's 4K HDR video quality is utterly insane and its pictures admittedly are still good...just not as good as the Pixel's. 

I'll have to have my Pixel by me going forward for when I need to take some pics of the little guy.

Obligatory photo of the pupper: https://imgur.com/a/jlgpJCz

EDIT: Wow, this blew up! I was not expecting this, lots of great conversation going on. For those asking for a comparison, I don't have a 1:1 comparison because again, the puppy won't sit still for more than two seconds. Here's a good picture of him I took with my iPhone, in better lighting conditions: https://imgur.com/a/3f4BBYj

And thank you for all the puppy compliments! We love him very much, his name is Moshe and he's 11 weeks old. We just got him two weeks ago and I've probably taken more photos/videos in that two-week span than I have in all of 2020."
GooglePixel,The worst part about owning a Pixel 3: Constant Google Newsfeed stories and notifications about price drops,"I'm sure I'm not the only owner who did a TON of research on the Pixel 3 before I bought it (at launch! What a dolt)

Well, this clearly trained the Google Newsfeed algorithm that I must be desperate to hear about every single piece of Pixel news.

Unfortunately, from week one until 5 minutes ago, 90% of those are about price drops.

And yes, I know I can customize my feed and notifications. But I don't want to click ""I'm not interested in stories about the Google Pixel"". Because I am! I'm interested when updates supposedly improve camera speed and ram management. I'd like to be informed if they find out that this phone gives you cancer. Or turns you into a newt.

GooglePixel,Is Gboard getting worse?,I have noticed in the past few months that Gboard has been autocorrecting words to completely different words. Essentially real words that are verified through googling it of all things aren't registered in Gboard as real words. Or in some cases it knows the word you typed is correct however it will still change it to something different even if it is  spelled correctly and within the right context of the sentence. This issue and the fact that swipe text seems to have gotten significantly worse as well. Has anyone else been experiencing this? Is it just me? Is it some early implementation of AI applications to autocorrect that's just not very good yet?

GooglePixel,Pixel Being a Smarter Smartphone,"I needed to call customer service at a faceless corporation, so I opened the phone app, dialed the number, and prepared to enter the gates of hell known as automated phone trees and long wait times. But just before pressing the call button, I was greeted with [this incredibly useful screen](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Fxj4vnDK4VyukPKW6).

Not only did the screen show the expected wait time, it gave me a daily summary of the expected wait times in case I wanted to call back at a less busy time. After dialing the number, the UI changed again and I was able to see a live transcription of the automated menus and could watch the options on screen so I didn't have to memorize each one before making my selection. And finally, once I made my menu selections, I was eventually placed on hold (yay), but instead of having to listen to the same pre-recorded message thanking me for my patience, I was able to use Hold For Me to stay on the line while I put the phone down and got some other work done.

It was a real bummer that Apple didn't roll out the XS' Smart HDR to the iPhone X.

GooglePixel,I made a teardown wallpaper of the Pixel 5 (and a template to create wallpapers to account for the zoom-in),"So I recently wanted a teardown wallpaper for my P5 but couldn't find one, so I deciced to make one. I used the ifixit X-Rays, the PBK disassembly, the JerryRig and an image of a qi coil.

[Here's what it looks like as my lock screen](https://i.imgur.com/VvXVexa.jpg)

I know, the qi coil is BS at that place but I just wanted it in there, so call it an artistic choice or whatever. [Here's one without the coil.](https://i.imgur.com/b46MGqR.jpg)

While trying to set it as my lock screen I ran in to two issues. One: You can't set a static image as your wallpaper/lock screen that fits the screen because it zooms in. The only way to prevent the zoom-in is with live wallpapers, so I tried KLWP but; Two: You can't set a live wallpaper as just your lock screen.

So I figured out the amount of zoom-in and made a template. You can download the Photoshop file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsd2Zwya3TZbr9VQj2EkB3MmI-JjWsbZ/view?usp=sharing). Maybe this can save someone some headaches and work in the future.

GooglePixel,Pixel 4 restrospective: how Google phones are hated at launch but suddenly cherished and loved after some time passes,"Hey, so I'm gonna start this by saying that I've never used a P4. I don't have any first-hand experience with its upsides or downsides, so yeah, there's that.

I just noticed a pattern where Google phones instead of being forgotten with time, somehow manage to age like fine wine. Seriously, look at every Pixel launch or even flagship launch and you'll see lots of people saying how the previous gen was just better, or how the current Pixel is a better deal..

P1 was called a weird iPhone rip-off, now it's a classic. P2 had the rockiest launch ever and now it's regarded as THE Google phone. P3 was laughed at for its weak design upgrades in the smaller model and a terrible notch on the XL, now it's considered a better buy than the P4. And the P4 was bashed into oblivion for ""the worst"" battery life, when now there are some articles even stating that Pixel 4 is generally a better deal than OnePlus's new offering. 

So I dunno, I guess Google did become the Apple or Android by making their phones age so gracefully despite being laughed at at launch. I just wish the first Pixel was a smashing success instead of a phone that just did well. I wonder how things would be now if that happened.

But hey, there's only one thing, and one thing only that truly matters.

Phone is phone.


Sincerely, Google

GooglePixel,"Finished with Flagships: Why I traded my P2XL for a P3a, and how it's been so far...","**Let me start by saying I've been an OG Nexus/Pixel user since the great Shamu, N6.** Before that, I was all-in on HTC devices. I've always appreciated great hardware and have done whatever I can to have the latest device.

**2017:** I pre-ordered my Just Black 64GB Pixel 2XL from Google Fi on launch day. I always wanted a Panda, but couldn't get one because Google is so great at stocking pre-orders...

Setting aside the ***4 RMAs*** *I had to do to get a decent screen and speakers that didn't rattle,* I really liked this phone. It looked sleek and futuristic, was fast and responsive, and got updates immediately. It was so much more premium than my OG Pixel, and yet it wasn't *so* huge that I couldn't hold it - even if it was the wrong color...

However, I could never reconcile the fact that it cost me **$850.** Nothing about the hardware or software (as great as that was) felt like it was worth that much. But I was able to sell my OG Pixel and make a decent enough back that I thought ""Meh, it is the best of the best...""

**2018:** The Pixel 3 launches, and for me, I couldn't justify the upgrade. Even with trade-in, the Pixel 3 was too expensive. I had also decided that while I liked my P2XL, I was growing weary of the size and determined I would go back to the #smallphonelyfe on my next device.

Then all the issues with P3 started surfacing, and I went ""Great job, u/mechgingeneer! You missed the lemon!""

(Note: I have used a P3 several times and it is noticeably nicer than my old P2XL - but the battery life and RAM issues were non-negotiable for me.)

**Early 2019:** The Pixel 3a launches. **Wait, it's only** ***how much?*** Like most, I was hyped - but concerned about performance. By this time, my P2XL had a few glitches, and battery life was starting to degrade - but overall, I was still happy. I read every thread out there comparing the P2 to the P3a, and the consensus was ""It's a side-grade at best - so wait for the Pixel 4."" And I did.

**Oct 15, 2019:** P4 launches, confirming my fears about the smaller P4. I waited for reviews, but ultimately, I knew I still couldn't justify the cost. I'd grown disillusioned with the fact that my $850 phone from two years ago was only worth **$143** to Google now. How could I justify that price increase?

By this time, my P2XL was showing its age. Some hiccups and bugs were pretty constant, and performance was better on Android 10, but still not at ""flagship"" level. And my hand was so *tired* of holding this thicc boi.

So I looked at my 2XL, scratches and all, and decided *""Flagships aren't worth it to me anymore.""*

I ordered a P3a, and told myself ""Use it for a week, and if you don't notice a difference, then you're ahead of where you were with the P2XL."" And *this time,* I got the color I wanted!

So my P3a arrives, and I'm immediately struck by the size and heft of the P3a - it feels too solid to be budget, but I know it is. I migrate my data over to the new phone, and put my 2XL in a drawer to await its possible resale on Swappa.

So after testing for two weeks now, I can safely say the ***Pixel 3a is the first phone in a LONG time that I have truly loved.*** There are no performance slowdowns, no battery anxiety, The camera is incredible (and yes, there *is* a noticeable difference between this and the P2XL). And it's the right size. And it cost me just over $300.

*Why would you ever use a flagship again?* I thought to myself. I might, one day when I have no student loans and money to burn. Or when Google can stop with the compromises of worse battery life in the smaller handset. Or when some new feature blows my mind. But if it's priced as high as the market is moving, then I'm done. I can't justify a $1000 rectangle in my pocket anymore.

Will I upgrade in the future? **Absolutely.** But I've changed my perspective from ""is the budget phone good enough"" to ""is the upgrade *worth* $500-600?"" So far, the answer is no - and I suspect it will be for quite some time.

*If you're a 2XL owner and have been considering the 3a or 3a XL*, I'm happy to answer questions or elaborate more. But for most, **I'd say the 3a truly is the resurrection of the Nexus 5** (And I owned and loved a Mint Nexus 5X). Can praise get any higher than that?

**TL;DR - I moved from the Pixel 2XL to the Pixel 3a, and have nothing but glowing recommendations for this phone. Regardless of what you read, I believe it IS an upgrade over the 2XL. I plan on sticking with the ""a"" series phones as long as they're around, and my wallet thanks me.**

GooglePixel,"Google mentions, then quickly removes 'Pixel 6' and 'Pixel 6 XL' from official form",
GooglePixel,New Feature Drop just started rolling out!,
GooglePixel,"Went to Best Buy, tried to find out the differences","I already preordered a regular Pixel 6, but I went into Best Buy and spent maybe 30 minutes with the two phones to see if I should cancel and get the Pro.

The things that I noted:

* Pro does feel better in hand, back to back it looks a hair thinner
* Camera visor looks to protrude just a tiny bit more on the regular pixel 6, also looks cheaper from the matte finish. If you care about how the visor looks on the phone naked, it does look just a little nicer on the pro.
* Both phones feel thinner than the iPhone 13 or S21 Ultra if you exclude the visor. This is mostly because of how much rounder the Pixels are compared to the flat sides of the iPhone. The iPhone 13's notch definitely isn't aging well. The regular Pixel 6 feels about the same as a S21 Ultra from the back in roundness and thickness. [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/TZqSXnh)
* Pro screen is noticeably brighter, you probably wouldn't miss it unless you currently have a Samsung at full brightness.
* Front cameras produce pictures that look like they're from different modules (hue/angles). After computational, the result is closer. The wider angle on the Pro would maybe get 1-2 more people in a group pic, in portrait mode it basically extended from my sternum to my belly button at arm's length.
* Most videos will appear bigger on the Pro screen once they fit to the width
* Text on the regular Pixel gets smaller, but not to the point where it's not clear. I use display settings on small, sometimes font on small. It's strange, sometimes the regular pixel has smaller text at the same setting, but more words will fit on the same line. I thought this would be a bigger discrepancy but font is clear enough on both. Text is larger on the Pro at similar settings. [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/URIj09C) (sorry for blurry, Pro is the left phone)
* The sound notifications setting sounds like a great idea (alert you to crying babies or smoke detectors). Not sure if I'd use it. [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/TrgjSpb)
* There's a sound amplifier setting to aid with boosting certain frequencies
* No squeeze to activate Assistant, but they make it so you can activate by long pressing the power button
* Video and pictures looked good on both, in Best Buy all photos kind of look the same. Computational photography makes them closer still.
* Pro can do up to 20x, the regular Pixel 6 up to 7x zoom. I held the phones in hand, there wasn't too much blur for either. You could focus on far away text at least, would be better with tripod.
* Pixel 6 has glossy buttons, Pro has matte buttons (both were stormy black)
* Fast scrolling through web pages, you could just tell that the Pro has a bit faster refresh. Really not a big difference.
* The rounded edges on the Pro didn't look any different to me compared to the S21 Ultra. Changing light reflection but no dark spots on the model I saw.
* Haptics were very similar, I played ringtones on silent and felt there wasn't really a difference except for the location. It's just more immediate in the Pro since it's located where you hold the phone, it's higher on the regular Pixel 6. Typing on both keyboards felt identical to me. The location does make a difference though, in how the haptics are perceived. I would say the haptics are just below top tier on other phones - they feel good but there's only 4 strength settings - there's a little less variability/range if that makes sense.

Overall, I think if you are in a mmWave service area and it's a $200 difference, you can definitely make a case for getting the Pro since it does feel nicer when you hold them side by side. It is very much like a Samsung phone, the curved edges make it look and feel thinner (the part you hold on the sides is thinner). The regular Pixel 6 has more plain, cheaper feeling finish (matte), but the back feels great. The way the visor looks on it is worse if you really really care about that, but if you're getting a case these things aren't going to be a big deal.

At a $300 difference, it's a bit harder to justify. While there were a lot of things the Pro did slightly better, and it does feel like a nicer phone, the Pixel 6 is such an easy recommend - and it lives up to that when you start factoring in certain personal preferences. The aesthetic reminds me a lot of my Pixel 4XL, I think if they didn't add the color it would be way more meh of a phone.

Both phones come with a surprisingly blank canvas, very few apps to the point if you're coming from a Samsung you'd be wondering if you're actually missing something. Android 12 is so simplistic in its execution, everything is less busy. But when you dig a little bit, you find out there's a setting for what you wanted, or one you didn't know you did.

GooglePixel,Please add squeeze back to the next Pixel,"I had my Pixel 2 for almost 3 years and I recently switched to the Pixel 4A 5G, because I was experiencing really fast battery drain on my Pixel 2. I love everything about the Pixel 4A 5G, but I really miss the squeeze feature. I didn't realize how much I used it until I accidentally started squeezing my 4A. It is just such a useful and underrated feature in my opinion, and I really hope they bring it back for future generation Pixels."
GooglePixel,My brother passed away and my mom put me in charge of his phone. Help.,"I have experience with Google pixels. I had a 3a until its death. His phone is a pixel 2. He had a formal will made (he had terminal cancer) and my mom is the executor so I'm sure if I fuck this up we could get access somehow but I'd like to do this all right.

I need to

~~A) back up his Google accounts to my phone number. His service will end soon with his phone provider so this is a top priority.~~

~~B) make sure I have all his photos and videos to his children safely secured (I think I've managed to do this) plus all his other photos and videos he's taken over the years. Thankfully he did a good job scrubbing his phone and there's nothing NSFW.~~

C) save all his text messages and Facebook messages between him and his exes. One has absolutely no guardianship over their daughter and my brother passed it along to my parents. Her texts are a goldmine of her maliciousness and how little she cares for their daughter, but occasionally she tries to weasel her way back in before disappearing again. His other ex is a good mom overall but was physically and mentally abusive towards my brother. I need these texts saved as well, in case she ever tries to keep our nephew away from us. I don't have the energy or mental stamina to go through them and save screenshots right now.

I know I could manage to do all these things safely and securely if I researched well, but I am also in the midst of planning his viewing and all the other things that come with a twenty nine years old man's passing, helping care for his two children, helping my parents while they manage this unbelievable grief, and being a mother to my two children and a full time student in a bachelor's program approaching finals.

I am finding a lot of somewhat helpful articles but I really want to do this absolutely properly.

Thank you for any and all help. And if anyone has any suggestions of things I back up that I didn't think of, please don't hesitate to share.

One last thing... fuck cancer

Edit: wow. I am completely overwhelmed by the response this got. I have been on reddit a long time, and you never know which way these kinds of posts can go. Clearly the pixel community is an extraordinarily kind community. I only need to figure out the Facebook messages and I will be complete. Thank you SO much for all your help, and for the condolences. My brother was an exceptional person and it breaks my heart his kids won't know their dad like we did - but this will help. Thank you thank you thank you!"

GooglePixel,"Tip: If you don't charge your Pixel overnight and have always-on display enabled, keep it face-down on a table. It'll turn off AOD and save a LOT of power","On the 2020 Pixels, at least. (I own a 4a 5G.) This is easier if you have a case that provides a bit of clearance over the screen.

I tried both AOD on and off on two consecutive nights. Keeping the screen visible (and thus AOD on) resulted in about 14% drain from bedtime to morning. Flipping the phone on its face (and thus AOD off) resulted in 0% drain over roughly the same amount of time. Yes, _zero_ drain. Started at full at bedtime, was still full when I woke up in the morning.

This also has the side benefit of preventing unnecessary burn-in from AOD.

I'm curious just how long I can squeeze out of my 4a 5G now... Even with all that drain overnight, I was still getting two days of use out of it. Wonder if I could stretch to three!"
GooglePixel,So far the Pixel 5 is as close to *my* perfect phone as I've had in a long time,"Not since the original Pixel have I been this fully satisfied with a phone. It's definitely not perfect, but it does a REALLY good job of covering so many of my core concerns. I was coming from a Pixel 3 XL, having owned the 2 XL, and 1 non-XL before that, (not to mention Nexi 5x, 6, 5, and 4 prior). My 3 XL, which I know is not universal, had become a deeply laggy mess. In particular it would frequently seize up for 1-3 seconds while doing an input (keyboard, swipe, tapping a button, or pressing volume) and then register it as though I had held down that control that whole time. It otherwise performed relatively well, but was still inconsistent. And battery life was pretty awful overall, with me often at 30% around 1PM (and this was after replacing a bloated battery). And memory management was horrific, with multitasking limited enough that depending on what I was doing, I wouldn't switch out of some apps because I knew I'd lose my place. Additionally 11 made everything worse, made Android Auto perform a lot more slowly, and made it so if I was doing anything too intensive (AA Maps + Podcast, or playing a game) the phone would constantly re-send the latest notification to my Wear OS watch, draining its battery. I was done.

The 5 fixes every single one of these issues. It's absurdly fast. I know there were concerns about the processor, and I know most people have dispelled them, but truly, for me, coming from the 3 XL the performance difference is night and day. No lags, fast task switching, fast and reliable interactions, just overall really beautiful. Photo processing is  the only downside here, and I do see it. It's recognizably slower and I do worry about how that'll be long-term. That's the only performance hit.

RAM management is an instant game changer (literally), as I can swap out of a game, check email, open a link, do some research, and go back to the game and pick up where I left off. It's exactly what I wanted.

Android Auto is SO much quicker and more responsive, consistently. And my watch battery is right now at 81% when driving with it would have driven it to the low 60s or mid-50s. Oh, and bonus: I have a magnetic mount in my car. On my 3 XL I originally used a case with a plate, but after I realized the plate completely screwed up the compass, I found that with a thin clear slightly grippy case, there was enough for the magnet to latch onto in the phone that it could sort of hold the 3 XL on its own. The 5, meanwhile, latches on HARD without a case and holds really solidly. Easy to remove, but doesn't fly off if I hit a heavy bump like the 3 XL. Bonus.

Also, totally subjective, but I really like the size. I mainly bought XLs for the battery, and this made that unnecessary. It's way more one-handable and light. Also the surface isn't slippery, and I'm not as terrified of dropping it, so I'm running without a case for now. And the green is very nice. My first non-black phone since the Nexus 6.

But the biggest thing of all that changes the entire game is the battery. The absolute lowest I've seen the phone since getting it (accounting for time charging while driving, or leaving it on a wireless charger which isn't optimized for this phone so is only putting out 5W max) is 69% outside of the first evening of over-use. And that's with the same normal use (probably more because it's new and exciting) I put my 3 XL through, including games, text messaging, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, research, OneNote, Excel, etc., etc., etc. This is my work and life phone and I use it a LOT. Today's the first day in YEARS I didn't carry an external battery in my pocket for safety. I seriously don't feel like I need it. It's taking work to get used to, but battery anxiety may be over with this phone. And honestly, this plus the RAM were the two biggest things I wanted from this phone and I got them.

It's not without issues. As mentioned, photo processing is slower. The haptics are a step down in quality from previous Pixels. The front speaker might as well just be the bottom-firing one because the left one's pretty junk (hoping for tuning in updates). Phone calls are \*fine\*, but definitely not as good, but I rely 80% on Bluetooth so that's not huge for me. Also the bottom speaker placement is annoying FOR ME, because I mostly hold my phone in my left hand, which means it rests on my pinky, and my pinky sits precisely on the speaker and blocks it. Hopefully I can adjust my hold to fix that.

So yeah, it has a few small issues that would probably bother me more if it weren't for the life-changing stuff above that really makes me so insanely happier with this phone. This phone is as perfect for ME as I can reasonably want.

I know there are a ton of these threads, but I still wanted to share my joy, and I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might have.

EDIT: Also, I live in LA, and use T-Mobile, so I happen to have 5G nearly everywhere I go which I honestly didn't expect. Some places where I had terrible LTE aren't any better. Everywhere else I've ranged as high as 160Mbps down and 98Mbps up, but usually have at least 30/40. Do I need that? Nah. But it's cool."

GooglePixel,Google's lack of global warranty on Pixels is behind the competition and a shame,"[Apple](https://store.apple.com/Catalog/Images/worldwidewarranty.html) has a global warranty where you can receive service from any of their local branches. [Samsung](https://samsungcarecentre.com/samsung-mobile-warranty-check-claim/) isn't as clear as Apple, but I also see things online that they try to offer an international warranty.

This wasn't something I had previously payed a lot of attention to, but while overseas, my Pixel's battery swelled up. I purchased my Pixel directly through Google, I am a subscriber to Google Fi (which touts international travel as a key advantage over the competition), and the battery swelled in a country where Google sells Pixels. Despite the Google stars basically aligning to the maximum extent possible, at the end of the day, since there is no global warranty, you're simply out of luck if something like this happens while outside your home country.

Customer service told me I would need to either wait until I flew back to the States or mail it back to a friend and have them process the replacement for me. I followed up again and asked how I could fly or mail a Pixel with a bulging battery safely and legally and they just ignored it and reiterated I should either fly or ship the phone. I even reached out to the special Reddit Requests helpline here that escalates problems when regular support isn't working. They took one look and said they were withdrawing the previous offer to replace my phone and I should find a responsible way to dispose of it locally. Honestly, with the apparent complete lack of internal infrastructure at Google to handle international problems like this, I can't fault them. The problem is in the warranty policy, and the policy sucks.

Google is one of the biggest multi-national companies on the planet. My case is just an example, but it's an example of how Google often seems to act as if the USA is the entirety of the world. If the competition can find a way to make global warranties work, there's really no excuse for Google if they want to make a serious play in the phone hardware game and not just have another side project hobby."
GooglePixel,I believe Google is moving in the right direction with the Pixel line.,"This year, I feel like Google's vision for the Pixel line is significantly clearer and much less ambiguous.

Looking at this in the perspective of the Pixel 5, going for a more simplistic, straightforward, 'appeal to everyone' kind of approach, I think, is what Pixel needs to be, or in fact, was **meant** to be.

They have made a simple, clean, super effective, do it all phone that can impress and appeal to almost anyone.

They have given everything a person would need out of a phone, nothing more, nothing less. All in a comfortably compact 6 inch package for hundreds less than most flagships. No wonder it won Readers' Choice Smartphone of the Year. This is a Pixel like never before. **THIS** is what people have waited for Pixel to be for years. 

I believe Pixel phones are beginning to move in the right direction this year. No abysmal battery life, no bathtub notch, no failed experiments, just

**Simple.
Clean.
Minimalistic.
Effectivity.**

I feel like Pixel phones should be like the **iPhones of Android,** but better. 

Clean and simple, highly optimised, customisable, smooth software with long support, good hardware and durability, with things that people actually want and need in a phone, and some bells and whistles added in, brewed into a formula slowly developed and refined year after year into what could become some of the greatest phones on the market, all for a more **competitive price.** 

Please, Google, **keep moving in this direction.** This has great potential.

The googlepixel\_us account copied that photo in 2023 and posted it in [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqv9R9WP-dH/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqv9R9WP-dH/). The photo has close to 80k likes so far, which is probably the highest in their account. They did not provide any credits and chose to completely ghost us when we asked (in the post as well as in DM).

I am unsure what the exact source of their copy is - could be any of

1. Instagram (possibly not, as the crop in their post is wider)
2. My comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/debalin90/status/1285370963400380416?s=20)
3. Google Photos itself (I had it saved there in Storage Saver quality)
4. Some other surface that I either don't remember (took the photo \~3 years ago) or not aware of (in any case, they certainly did not credit or reach out to me or ask for permission before posting on IG)

Looking at other posts by the same account, seems like giving credit is common. I am not an Instagram celebrity or anything, but the ghosting didn't feel right after using my photo. Hence the question. Thanks!

GooglePixel,Collecting feedback related to settings and device configuration,"Hey Redditors, 

We're trying to collect feedback about configuring your Pixel phone - what are the pain points you have with managing, toggling, or discovering settings? 

In particular, do you ever run into any of the following types of issues with your Pixel:
 
1. **There's a setting you constantly have to manage yourself** (e.g. you turn Bluetooth on and off 10 times a day)
2. **There's a setting you love, but wish you had found out about earlier** (e.g. you are a big DND user, but never realized there was a DND scheduling feature)
3. **There's a setting or configuration you wish your phone could be smarter about** (e.g. why can't my Pixel put itself in airplane mode when I'm taking off in a plane?)
4. **There's a setting or configuration you wish your phone could remind you about** (e.g. I wish my phone could make sure I don't forget to silence my phone at work)
5. **There are settings you changed the second you setup your phone** (e.g. I turned off haptic feedback right away after setting up my Pixel)

We don't have any features or product plans to announce right now, but we hope to incorporate this feedback to improve your Settings experience on Pixel devices in the future. 

For any pain points or feedback you have, it would also be great if you could explain as much as you can about your context and why it is a pain point. For instance, if there's a setting you toggle 20 times a day, explain the scenarios where you need to manage the setting. This will help us better understand how to address the problem. 

Thanks, and we look forward to hearing your feedback!

GooglePixel,I've used every Pixel phone. Here are my thoughts on the Pixel 5 after a few months of use.,"Hey guys,

So I've had the privilege to own every Pixel flagship device and I've loved every iteration despite the quirks. When the Pixel 5 was announced, I was a bit mixed on Google's decision to use midrange specs.

On paper, if you compare specs, the Pixel 5 seems worse than the Pixel 4XL. It's got a lower resolution screen, an inferior processor and GPU, no neural core chip for faster image processing, and a body covered in a material that feels more like plastic than metal.

Despite my assumptions, I decided to give it a fair chance. So, after using the phone for a few months, here are my thoughts on the Pixel 5.

Performance

The Pixel 5 has, what many may call, a midrange processor and GPU. Based on benchmarks, it's closer to the Pixel 3 when it comes to raw performance.

However, when it comes to real-world usage, it's pretty much impossible to tell that the phone is running on a mid-range processor. The phone runs very smoothly and handles pretty every task without any stutters. I must say that I don't game on my phone, so the experience might be a bit different for people who game a lot. The 8 gigs of RAM made sure apps didn't have to reload often and the fast refresh rate of the screen made for a very pleasant experience.

If I were to nitpick, I'd say the only time I noticed the phone didn't have flagship specs was when I took a bunch of photos and had to wait for the photos to process. To be honest, it's not something most people would notice.

I do have concerns about the long-term performance of the phone though. Right now, it's running flawlessly, but as apps get more demanding over time, the phone has the potential to be worse than the phones with high-end processors.

Design

As someone who prefers smaller phones, I love the Pixel 5. It's very light and super comfortable to hold. The size is great for one-handed use. Size-wise, it's close to the iPhone 11 Pro, but thinner and much lighter.

In terms of materials, the phone's back is made from recycled aluminum with cutouts for wireless charging. In terms of durability, it's fantastic as I don't have to worry about cracking the back. But it comes to in-hand feel, it doesn't feel like metal because of the bio-resin coating Google has on it. So, if you associate quality with the cold feeling of metal and glass, you might think it doesn't feel as premium and that's a fair critique. I wish Google went for brushed aluminum like the first Pixel or HTC M7/M8.

I don't mind it at this price because the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. Also, I like how grippy the phone is due to the bio-resin texture. It won't slip out of your hands easily.

Screen

The screen is absolutely beautiful. The resolution has downgraded to 1080p though, but due to the smaller size, I can't tell the difference. It looks plenty sharp and there's no pixelation.

Also, this is one of the only phones with perfectly symmetrical bezels. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but I appreciate that attention to detail.

The 90hz refresh rate is great. It makes everything look fluid and I think that feature alone is worth it over the Pixel 4a XL. As I mentioned in my [Note 20 review](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote20/comments/iw4a5q/honest_thoughts_on_the_note_20_ultra_after_3_weeks/), the difference between 60hz and 90hz is significant, but not that much between 90hz and 120hz. So, most users would be pretty happy with the 90hz refresh rate.

It's not all perfect though. Auto brightness on this phone isn't great. Sometimes it lowers the brightness for no reason, which forces me to manually adjust the brightness.

Battery

One of the biggest reasons to get the Pixel 5 is the battery life. This is easily the longest-lasting Pixel flagship in my experience. I can easily go a full day with this and not worry about charging. The Pixel 4XL in comparison barely made it to the end of the day.

In terms of screen on time, I'm consistently getting around 6 hours on a full day of use with a bunch of standby time baked in. I'm currently daily driving the S21 Ultra and I'd say the battery life of the Pixel 5 is very close to the S21 Ultra, which is amazing.

Camera

The camera is the one thing I'm slightly disappointed by this year. Don't get me wrong. It's still one of the best cameras out there, but it's pretty much the same camera as the Pixel 4 line. Google has been using the same sensor since the Pixel 3 and improvements have only been incremental since then.

The Pixel phones have been popular because of the camera quality and I think Google is starting to lose that advantage. In terms of quality, I'd rank it at #3.

I do appreciate that Google added a wide-angle camera this time. But it's not as wide as what you get on a Galaxy or iPhone. I'd love to see an even wider wide-angle and a dedicated zoom camera in the next Pixel.

The new software features are also helpful this time. For example, I like that I no longer need to get into Night Sight each time when needed. It automatically switches to it similar to Apple. For those who don't like it, Google has now added the option to turn it off. Also, Google has added the ability to take portrait shots with Night Sight, which is pretty sweet.

And while the front camera placement is aesthetically pleasing, it's not the best place to put it for usability reasons. You have to retrain yourself to hold the phone to your side instead of the centre if you want to take a symmetrical selfie.

Sensors

There's no face unlock this time. I think the Pixel 4XL face unlock was just as good as iPhones. But, in a pandemic hit world, fingerprint is better than face unlock in my opinion. The placement is great and the circular design provides a big enough surface area. It works flawlessly and it's incredibly fast. In my experience, it works way better than the S21 Ultra.

Google removed a couple of sensors this time. First, there's no Soli, which I don't mind. I don't think it was implemented well on the Pixel 4XL. The technology is quite interesting, so I hope Google brings it back at some point when it's better.

And no squeeze functionality for the Assistant. Although I rarely used it, it was good to have for fast access to the assistant. The gesture replacement isn't that good.

Speakers

When the phone came out, most reviewers bashed the speakers. So I was expecting the speakers to be horrible. To be honest, they're not as bad as the reviews made me believe. I've had no issues taking calls or watching content. Yes, when comparing side by side with iPhone or Galaxy phones, you can tell the sound isn't as rich, but it's not nearly as bad. Also, the update in December improved the quality with adaptive sound.

Haptics

My last point is on the haptics. The vibration motor isn't as good as the 4XL or the iPhones. The iPhones are the gold standard and no Android phone comes close. I think the Pixel 4XL had one of the better vibration motors, so it was a bit sad to see the motor wasn't that good on the Pixel 5. It might not be big deal to you, but I think a good vibration motor makes a big difference. I hope Google improves it in the next generation.

Worth it?

Overall, I think the Pixel 5 is the most well-rounded phone Google has made. The price, while slightly higher than I'd like is not too bad and the user experience is flagship level despite the mid-range specs.

If you have a Pixel 4, I don't recommend getting it unless you want a better battery. But if you have an older Pixel, I think it's a pretty good buy."

GooglePixel,"PSA: Pixel/Nexus updates can still be subject to carrier approval | AKA - Where is my update, and why?","If you purchased a Nexus or Pixel phone, regardless of where, the updates do come direct from Google. There is no disputing that. However, carriers are still involved in the process, and this is what leads to the largest amount of confusion surrounding the process. I'm going to attempt to clarify the Nexus/Pixel update process, and I will be sourcing everything that I can, to include citing Google employees directly.

First, let's cover the basics. If you have a phone that receives updates direct from Google's servers, you are subject to Google's OTA rollout process. This only impacts phones that get their updates direct from Google, so your Samsung Galaxy Whatever is not impacted (except for the S4 GPE, which I believe is done with updates anyway).

## How the Google OTA Rollout Process Works

Per Google engineer Dan Morrill; [DIRECT SOURCE] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1r1dz4/44_kitkat_has_started_rolling_out_on_the_n4/cdiwt6f/) | [EXTERNAL SOURCE] (https://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-engineer-Dan-Morrill-talks-about-Android-OTA-updates-and-why-you-need-to-be-patient_id49573)

> Rollouts are conducted in phases. Typically they start at 1% of devices for around 24 - 48 hours; we watch the return rates and resulting device checkins and error reports (if any), and make sure nothing looks wrong before sending it to more. Then typically it goes to 25%, 50%, 100% over the course of a week or two.

> What the percentages mean is that when your device checks in, it has a 1% chance (for example) of being offered the OTA. If it doesn't (randomly) get an offer, it will never get an offer until the next batch.

> IOW, once your device checks in and gets turned down, that's it until the next batch. Mashing on the ""check for updates"" button just causes your device to check in again, and get automatically turned down again. Think about how that makes your device feel! WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE PHONES?!

> That said, once the new batch does start, hitting that button does give you a new roll of the dice -- but once. Since devices usually only check in for system updates every 24 hours (I think? Certainly on a many-hours basis) this can get you your shot sooner than it would happen on its own.

> So, mash away. :) Just be patient, and mashing on it more often than once or twice a day isn't going to gain you anything.

> Edit: also, keep in mind that this isn't first-come/first-served. You're not racing other devices to get your slot in the current batch, or something.

## A Change to the 'Check Update' Button

Ok, so it takes a few weeks, and hitting the update button does nothing. Well, that was from 3-4 years ago, and things change. We saw an update in 2017 that altered this, and learned of it courtesy of Google employee Elliott Hughes; [DIRECT SOURCE] (https://plus.google.com/+ElliottHughes/posts/2VmmB3jfeTp)

> One thing I haven't seen the tech press notice is that the button in Settings to check for an update actually works now. If you're running the latest Google Play Services, you shouldn't need to sideload an OTA or flash a system image just because you're impatient...

> How does this interact with the Google's staged rollout of new OS releases, you ask? When a device checks in because you've specifically asked it to, we flag that this is user-initiated and so you're not subject to the usual limitations. So even if we're at 1% rollout and 1% of users already have the update, if you manually check you'll still be offered it, even though a background check at the same time wouldn't.

## Carrier Involvement

However, he since edited it based on questions from myself and others, and added this gem:

> How does this interact with your carrier's additional restrictions? (This was a question that came up a lot in the comments.) If your carrier hasn't approved the update, their restrictions will still apply if you're on their network.

And herein lies the problem that causes so much contention; the carrier's role in this process. Google has agreements with various carriers that allow for certain perks for both sides. One of these perks for the carrier is the ability to review the update for compatibility for that carrier's specific features. And yes, Apple deals with this too. Apple, however, releases their update when EVERY carrier is done (and due to Apple's market position, they get priority in the review process, further speeding this up). Google, on the other hand, pushes the update when it's ready, regardless of carrier status. If your carrier isn't involved, you're eligible for the update. If your carrier has approved the update, then you're eligible for the update. And if your carrier has not yet approved the update, then you are not yet eligible for the update. When the carrier approves it, Google will push it to you.

And it's not just carrier approval. In some case, Google actually does full builds for certain carriers. For example, if you check [Google's OTA links page for the OG Pixel] (https://developers.google.com/android/ota#sailfish), you'll see custom builds for Verizon, Rogers, Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile, Project Fi, and even just ""Europe."" When your sim is detected and your carrier has a custom build, THAT is the update that you will receive.

As bad as this sounds, the Nexus 6 was Google's worst offender. Regardless of where you bought your phone from, installing a sim from AT&T would not just associate your phone to the carrier, but [it would also download AT&T bloatware (which could be removed, thankfully)] (https://gizmodo.com/at-t-will-muddy-up-your-nexus-6-with-bloatware-1657796686). Other carriers also had this perk with the Nexus 6 and, thankfully, this perk went away with the 5X, 6P, and Pixel lineup. And just to reiterate, [it didn't matter where you bought your Nexus 6 from.] (https://phandroid.com/2015/03/12/nexus-6-verizon-backup-bloatware/)

## Carrier Association, and How it Works

When you first boot up your phone with a carrier's sim installed, that phone becomes associated to that carrier in Google's database. This is NOT a carrier lock, and it is used by Google for identification purposes. Allow me to demonstrate

* [Click Here] (https://play.google.com/store?hl=en&tab=w8) (EDIT: Do this on your PC, not your phone)
* Click the gear icon in the top right and select ""Settings""
* Under my devices, you'll see the carrier association(s) of all your Android devices that currently have your Google account linked.

In my case, I have T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T for certain phones. My Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield ATV, and LG Watch Style are listed as ""No carrier.""

Google maintains this list and, when they push out an update, all phones associated to a carrier that has approved the update, or a carrier that has no role in the process, receive that update. Carriers that have yet to approve the update are not pushed the update.

You can change your carrier association by swapping to a different carrier's sim and rebooting. Or, you can delete your carrier association by powering down, removing the sim (do not reinsert), powering up, and performing a full factory reset. With no sim installed, the fresh phone has no carrier association and will pull the latest available update.

## Live Demonstration

[Here's the video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgO29_yN9M&feature=youtu.be), and for those who can't watch right now, below is a summary of what happened. Please note that I will be demonetizing the video (no ads from me) for 48 hours or for however long this is on the front page of the posted sub(s), whichever lasts longer. I do normally like to monetize my (admittedly low quality) content, but my goal with this video and associated post was to spread knowledge, not make a quick buck.

* Demonstrated that it is a Pixel 2, on the T-Mobile network, with the 8.0 September software installed.
* Manually checking for update shows that system is up to date.
* I swapped sim to AT&T, who does not review Pixel 2 updates to the same degree (if at all) that T-Mobile does.
* Upon power on and connecting to the AT&T network, the update is available and begins to install. I power down.
* Reinstalling the T-Mobile sim and powering up actively blocks the install of the update, and once again states that 'system is up to date' with the September software.

## Why I Didn't Complete the Install

This isn't just the November security update for the Pixel 2. It's also the October security update, has some bug fixes, and even some minor UI changes. Google has already done a custom one for Deutsche Telekom (DTAG) and Verizon. I suspect that one is coming for T-Mobile (and possibly Project Fi carriers). If this is the case, then the existing ""normal"" update could impact or even break any of the following features; Wifi Calling, VoLTE, ViLTE, RCS. T-Mobile has proprietary implementations of each (God forbid we use the active standards...), so Google has to develop for this, and T-Mobile likes to test it.

## How Nexus/Pixel Updates Work on T-Mobile US (and likely other partner carriers)

For this, I don't have a direct source, but I will provide a source at the end that confirms that this is exactly how it works on Verizon. For T-Mobile, I'm basing this on several years of experience with Nexus/Pixels devices on the carrier, and the fact that my experience matches the confirmed Verizon process.

* Android OS updates - Anything that changes the version number is subject to T-Mobile review and may be delayed (the 7.1 update on my Nexus 5X was 1-2 months behind global rollout)
* Security Updates - Anything that ONLY modifies the phone based on the latest security bulletin does not get reviewed by T-Mobile, and hits phones the same day as the global rollout
* Software patches - Anything that modifies the functionality of the phone more than just a security update, but doesn't alter the Android version number, is still subject to T-Mobile review (the current Pixel 2 update being a perfect example).

[And here's the link detailing the same process for Verizon.] (https://9to5google.com/2016/10/06/google-confirms-that-verizon-will-handle-system-updates-for-pixels-it-sells-but-google-will-still-manage-security-updates/)

> Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store.

I'm still digging and may update this later, but I recall Google/Verizon later clarifying the system updates, and that ""managing"" meant still coming direct from Google, AFTER Verizon approval. Also, even the unlocked models ended up getting the 'Verizon' branded firmware (likely for feature compatibility).

## Conclusion

You Nexus/Pixel phone may be subject to carrier restrictions which delay software updates. You can circumvent this by using ADB with the [factory images] (https://developers.google.com/android/images) or [OTA images posted] (https://developers.google.com/android/ota) on Google's website. Alternatively, if you don't want to use ADB, you can circumvent the carrier association by swapping sims, or removing and performing a factory reset.

But for MOST users, I recommend waiting the additional days or weeks for the update just in case there was a carrier-specific firmware, or carrier-specific bug fix that was needed.

GooglePixel,Pixel 5 review after 2 weeks of use,"Hey everyone, I’ve been using the Pixel 5 for about 2 weeks now. Let me give you my thoughts on the device. 

I came from a Pixel 2XL that I owned for 2 years. I changed for the Pixel 5 because of: 

* the great deal in Europe, charging “only” 613€ and giving you the Bose headphones 
* the expectation of a much better battery 
* the expectation of a much better screen 
* looking forward to a smaller screen for easier and more practical one-handed use 
* the upcoming lack of security updates on the Pixel 2XL 
* my P2XL getting worse regarding battery and small “breakdowns” like getting pretty hot and stuttering 

So let’s see how my expectations turned out in reality. 

I can say that I am very happy with the Pixel 5. Actually, all my expectations have been met. The biggest and most important improvement for me is the **battery**. I used to need to charge my P2XL once midday to have it last till the evening. With the P5, I have not managed to get it below about 25 percent in the evening, regardless of heavy use. I am a journalist, so I have to do a lot of research, note-taking and talking on the phone during the day, plus taking photos and short videos. The P5 gives me the relieving feeling that I can count on it to not die on me during the day – not matter how extensive the use will be. On days with less usage I arrived at home with 65 percent. That is so f’in great! 

Next up let me talk about the **screen**. This phone is fun and enjoyable to use and look at. Surfing, texting, watching YouTube is just that tiny bit nicer when you have a crisp, bright screen with even bezels. The higher refresh rate definitely shows when scrolling fast. The only thing that could have been better is the maximum brightness. In the brightest sunlight, the P5 screen is still readable, but it would have to be about 20 percent brighter to make it perfect. 

The P5 is a no-BS phone, meant to be used rather than admired. Do you understand what I mean? This phone is built to serve you during the day, and is less appealing to the **premium phone** **concept** like the iPhone does. The P5 is a nice-looking phone, but I like that it does not give me anxiety to drop it and shatter its glass back. I like that the aluminium back may look a bit boring, but it convinced be that I will use this phone without a case. There are no cutting-edge manufactured, shiny edges or backs. I do not fear to damage this phone easily, I think I will rock this phone naked for about a year and then refresh the look with a dbrand skin. This may not be for everyone – many people do like premium-looking phones to show off. I am not one of the them. The P5 does look nice, but it doesn’t stand out. To me, that is an advantage. 

Now let’s get to the **speakers**. I do not feel they are a deal-breaker at all. You can definitely watch videos and listen to podcasts on this device without being bothered by the tinnier top speaker. I do listen to a lot of talking podcasts on the phone while I cook etc., and the quality to me is not even that much worse than on the P2XL. Music might be a different issue, but I never listen to music on the phone – I use Chromecast, Fire TV, or of course headphones for that. It’s been a trade-off made by Google – the right one, in my opinion: I’d rather have even bezels and no notch than better speakers than those used in the P5. 

**To** **sum it up**, the P5 is everything I loved and love about Google phones. (My “career” has been: Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5, (OnePlus One,) Pixel 2XL, Pixel 5.) They are great to use, they offer tons of customization, they have great cameras, and they always receive updates first. For me, the step down the price range by building a less-premium phone is exactly the right direction. 

I can’t really say what I would even **improve** about this device. Maybe build in top speakers, mirroring the bottom ones, if that is possible? And maybe drop the price even a little more, towards 550 or 500€. But apart from that, I’m just really happy, especially considering the Bose deal. 

And no, I do not have **gap issues**, I’m probably one of the lucky ones… 

Feel free to ask any questions. Have a great day!"

GooglePixel,"Phone (most likely) stolen by FedEx driver. FedEx acknowledges phone was ""lost"". Google won't file claim and won't replace phone.","This is a long story, but sharing all the details here. Welcome to my last 4 weeks of customer support hell. 

I ordered a Pixel on Dec 2, 2018 and received confirmation that the phone would be shipped on January 4, 2019.  I went out of town over the holidays and returned January 1 to an email stating that my phone had been delivered on the 28th of Dec. Only problem? No phone was at my house. 

I called Google and they identified that FedEx had said it was successfully delivered and gave me the name of the person who signed for it . I shared that this was not my name (which they knew) and that I was thousands of miles away when the phone was theoretically delivered. Additionally, the phone was delivered 6 days prior to when it was initially reported to be delivered and I was not provided with any updates information alerting me that it was going to be shipped.  Google said they would ""make sure I was taken care of"", would investigate, and would get back to me.  

After multiple attempts at getting updates, Google finally responds two weeks later stating that they are closing my case because FedEx confirmed that the phone was successfully delivered. I escalated and was told that a supervisor would look further into it. 

A few days later I am told that because my case was already closed and FedEx confirmed delivery there's nothing they can do. I call back to yet another customer support person and am told that I need to contact FedEx.  I do so. 

FedEx chats me with me and shares that they will investigate and get back to me. I wait a few days and FedEx finally reports back that it was a seasonal worker who delivered the package. They  identify that there isn't anything they can do, but note that they will mark my package as ""package unable to be found."" They tell me that Google must file a claim as the shipper. 

I call Google back with this information and am told that they will file a claim with FedEx.  I am promised information in 2 days. 3 days later, I email back to see what the status is. Google emails back and shares that because I had already escalated and found that the package was successfully delivered I must open the claim with FedEx myself. Now remember,  FedEx already told me that I couldn't do this. 

This is starting to be entirely ridiculous.  I call Google again,  explain the situation and ask if we can call FedEx together. They say they'll look into it. I get an email a few days later (again) that there's nothing they can do.

 I call back, explain the situation .again . and they finally agree to call FedEx with me. We make a plan to do so the next day when the support person can get the right individual on the line. 

Which brings us to today, a month after the phone was ""lost."" I call FedEx again on my own ahead of time and they give me a reference number for the lost package.  The customer support person from Google  then calls me 30 minutes after we had agreed to chat and says, ""oh yeah, hey, sorry. Because you already had an escalation which resulted in us finding the package was successfully delivered there nothing we can do. File a claim with FedEx."" 

Wtf do I do? I feel like I'm talking in circles and don't know what other recourse I have at this point. FedEx won't let me file a claim and Google won't reach back out to FedEx (despite me giving them the lost package reference number from FedEx as well). 

Update: through a combination of escalations and support from this thread,  Google has confirmed that they will send me a replacement.  Now just to make sure that this one makes it into my hands!"

GooglePixel,Thank You Google!,"Well, my Pixel finally crapped out today. It got smashed a few weeks ago in all the insanity that is hurricane prep, but all that happened was a smashed back and front (using a rhinoshield). However, this week, I started noticing some issues with the screen, which made me think that there was a deeper issue. Well, this morning I woke up and 99% of the screen was covered in black/purple swirls and my touches weren't being read at all. 

I hadn't wanted to fix my phone, since the new iPhone X and XL2 are both coming soon, and I'd just lost my job due to the hurricane and didn't want to blow $300 when I could just finance the new phone when it comes out like usual. Unfortunately, that didn't look like an option anymore, as I need a phone for my job hunt and can't wait the month or two it'll take to get a new one. So, I went in to my local UBreakIFix to get just the screen repaired, which is usually $150 or so. Shockingly, they told me they would replace and repair everything wrong with the phone, for free, as Google was paying all costs associated with Pixel repairs in Florida. I honestly wanted to cry, as I've been really disheartened with all of the shit going on recently, so to have something actually work out so well was a huge relief.

So, in the end I just want to thank Google for doing something to help someone right now. "

At a Christmas gathering yesterday, I mentioned that I would take the family group photo since I know how amazing the Pixel 3XL pictures are.  But when someone went to turn the light on for ""better lighting"", I said not to worry about it.  They scoffed at me, completely expecting another picture needing to be taken.  When the picture was taken (with Night Sight enabled), everyone was BLOWN away!  Five other people commented several times how amazing the feature was.  The person who scoffed was amazed as well!

GooglePixel,Warning: do not chargeback any Google purchase unless you want to risk losing all your Google accounts and data.,"Someone just [posted a TIFU yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/zndbku/tifu_by_accidentally_buying_two_google_pixels_and/) about charging Google back on a Pixel and Google banned their account. Horrifying cautionary tale. How do they even get away with doing this?

Google is notorious for their terrible customer service so buyer beware if you're having trouble with trade-ins, missing packages, RMA returns, or anything else. A quick search shows a lot of people have lost their accounts or lost the option of buying anything with their Google account after they charged back Google.

If you have a choice, don't buy directly from Google.

If you have to buy directly from Google, use a email that is not your main Google account and do not link the emails.

P.S. this seems to apply to charging back any company that you have an active account with. If you charge back Steam or EA, they'll ban your account and you'll lose access to all your games."

GooglePixel,"After using the Bellroy leather case on the Pixel 7 for only 4 months, it is already tearing and peeling and Bellroy support says this is ""not a manufacturing fault"". Be warned about this product.","I bought a Pixel 7 Pro in October and my wife bought a regular Pixel 7. We both decided to splurge on a better case this time around and went with the Bellroy leather cases. These cases are $60 each, so about $120 in total.

After only 4 months of standard, regular use, BOTH of our cases have started to tear and peel at the corners. See images here: [https://imgur.com/a/rwMNpyQ](https://imgur.com/a/rwMNpyQ)

Given this product was $60 and only lasted 4 months, I thought clearly this should be covered by Bellroy and can't be normal damage. I contacted Bellroy, showed them the images, and this is the response they sent me:

&#x200B;

*""Thanks so much for your patience and for confirming. We've reviewed the condition of your phone case from the photo and the area where the leather is peeled wouldn't be considered a manufacturing fault. Our production team has confirmed that this product is a full wrap leather product and unlike previous releases. To be clear, due to the construction of these cases, the leather we are using is thinner than the other cases which makes them less padded and have an increased risk of being damaged by other objects.""*

""*As such, putting the case on a rough surface, dropping them on soft/hard surfaces, or accidentally scratching them to a surface with a sharp object might end up with similar results. Based on the information provided this has been deemed as accidental damage from normal use so we're afraid that this isn't eligible for a warranty replacement.  I understand that this might be disappointing however we hope this doesn't stop you from continuing with us or loving future Bellroy.""*

&#x200B;

I basically got told from Bellroy that their case falling apart in 4 months is because they make it with cheap, thin leather, therefore this kind of wear is expected but it is not a manufacturing fault.....even though they manufactured it cheaply. OK, whatever, that is the first and last time I ever buy a Bellroy product, and I wanted to warn people here as well as see if anyone has had similar experiences with their cases?"
GooglePixel,1 week with my 2XL and everyone has overblown the screen issues + this camera is un-fucking-believable,"I'll be honest, I was a bit disappointed with the blue shift when I first got the phone. Then, after using it for a while, it's not noticeable in normal use so I was feeling okay about. Then, I realised how long the battery was lasting - 6.5 hours screen on time, the front facing speakers have been amazing, then... Then, I started using the camera this weekend.

This camera... Fuck me. I like to take photos with my DSLR but I'm not a pro or anything. After seeing the quality of this camera, there are very few circumstances that I'll be needing my DSLR.

After a week of use, all the noise about the flaws of this phone - I'm annoyed that I listened to any of it. This phone is the bees knees. By far the best camera on any phone and I wouldn't trade it in for any other phone on the market.

About 12 hours later I received an email that the credit was in my account. This morning, I checked and confirmed.

Yeah, it would be nice if I was a bit more in the positive from this due to the effort required by me, but as long as I'm made whole, there's not much to complain about. Thanks to the kind souls who guilded the previous thread, that means a lot to me.

GooglePixel,The Pixel Still Impresses,"I met up with a bunch of friends I haven't seen in years and we wanted to take a group photo. Instead of forcing 1 person to take the photo, we set up someone's Pixel 3 on a fireplace mantel, with the screen facing the group, and set the timer to AUTO.

For those that don't know, if you set the timer to 3 seconds or 10 seconds, then the phone counts down and takes a single photo. This sucks when doing group photos because someone always blinks.

With the timer set to AUTO, the camera waits until it detects facial expressions like a smile and will keep taking photos each time a smile is detected. Well, this worked perfectly, even with a large group of 12 adults and 10 kids. They were amazed when the camera snapped after we all said ""cheese"".

It was a nice win for the Pixel. iPhone owners in the group kept asking if their phone could it to. Like the old droid commercials... iPhone can't."

GooglePixel,Got the Pixel Buds Pro earlier,"I just received them, maybe a mistake from Fnac... They work really well, I love them ~~but the Pixel Buds app don't work since it's not updated yet.~~ [More info about Pixel Buds app with the Buds Pro](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/w7x9g1/pixel_buds_pro_more_info/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Edit : 1 day later

Hey there,

I decided to tell you about everything I know and have tested about the Buds Pro, that you don't have to search all my answers through the comments. You can find all the pictures and the mic test about them [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/w61knw/comment/ihbi45t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**,** or in the comments.

# How did I get them earlier ?

I just ordered them on Fnac. The ""Pre order"" state wasn't there when I ordered it, so they shipped it as a normal package.

# What's inside the box

When you receive your package, you will find in there the **carry case** where are the **Buds**. They are **already fully charged** (the Buds and the case) so you don't have to wait. You will also find **eartips** in a white tube, the instruction manual and the warranty one.

There's **no USB-C cable** in the box, so be sure to have one or have a wireless charger.

# Design and comfort

I thought first that Buds pro were **very large** as we saw on Google pictures but **they are clearly not that large**. I have small ears and they fit in (pictures in the link above) so I'm pretty happy with. You can lay down on bed with them even sleep.

**Buds Pro are definitely more confortable than the previous version** (I only owned the series A version). I wore them today for 6 hours without interruption and I don't have this little pain as I got with the series A. You completely forget them and **you also don't have the feeling of having your ears clogged**.

The case feels nice and is more round-shaped than the series-A one, so a little larger. When I put them on light, there is also less reflexion on Pro case.

# Are they secure ?

Buds pro feels less secure than the Series A, but **they are still secure.** I was afraid first about them falling while eating, walking, running, biking, etc... But they are clearly not ! **You can definetly wear them while doing your favorite sport, just be sure to use the right eartips and insert the buds until that they feel snug and sealed.**

# Touch controls

You can **do everything you could do with the Series A** (check the manual on the pictures). Except that you **can also control the volume by swipping the Buds** and that pressing the Buds for 2 seconds ~~will not activate the assistant~~ but the ANC mode.

# Audio quality

I can't describe the audio quality because I don't have the words for and every ears are different but they are better than the Series A.

If you need the **bluetooth codec**, it's **AAC**.

# Mic test

I'm not confortable talking English but I tried. I don't have the perfect voice to mic test but you still get some samples.

You can listen to the **4 samples** I did for you in the link above. **It has to be you to judge the microphone quality** because I don't care about the mic, I just need one who works well and where you can hear me clearly. They do it so they are fine for me.

I also went outside, took my bike and drove around. I called my mother while biking, there was some wind, but she said that she can hear me clearly.

# Latency

I tested the latency with Youtube and some games. **I didn't notice latency on Youtube**, but I think that normal. There's also no latency using my computer and playing some battle royale games as Fortnite and Naraka Bladepoint. Otherwise, **on some games** like Geometry Dash, Arcaea, **you can notice a lag between the image you see and the sound you hear...** I just tested those games, if you have more apps, or games, to ask me to try, just tell me.

# Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode

**ANC works pretty well.** I can't compare it with other device because I don't own earbuds with ANC, except the Bose 700 I got when there was Pixel 6 preorder. But ANC works. Just need to press one earbud for 2 seconds.

If ANC is not activated, then the Transparency Mode will be active and it is a really really great mode. **You can hear all your surrounding** (voices, vehicles, noises, etc...) without taking off your Buds and **slightly louder than usual**. Even my voice was louder than usual lmao.

FYI, you can't active both mode at the same time.

# Multipoint Mode

You can definitely **connect the Buds Pro on two devices**. Even on a Windows computer. I didn't test on Mac because I don't own one, but I'm sure they do too.

You can switch media pretty easily, but you have to be sure to pause or stop the media on the first device and then press play on the other.

I also tested the feature I was watching a video on Youtube and asked my family to call on my phone. It works, well just in this way for now. The media you are playing will pause automatically and your buds will switch to your phone that you can answer.

But I also tested when I was listening a media on my phone and then someone calls me on **Teams** or **Discord**. **Unfortunately** it doesn't pause the media on my phone, doesn't switch, and also you can't hear the bell of your computer. It will switch only if you are in front of your computer, see the call and answer it with your mouse. Maybe I did someting wrong...

# Google Assistant

Assistant works just by saying ""Hey Google"". ~~But~~ **~~I didn't find a way to activate it using the touch control~~**~~.~~ According to the manual, you have to choose between ANC control and Google assistant when you touch and hold the Buds. ANC control will be set by default. I'm sure you can change that using the Pixel Buds app, but it's not updated yet.

# Battery

The battery of the Buds Pro is great. It **lasts long**. I just wore them for 6 hours and they went from 100% to 30%. **Both buds** **discharge equally**. They still can have 1 or 2% of difference but it's random.

They c**harge up really fast tho**, I'm even surprised about how fast they are when charging up. Even the case wirelessly (I actually use the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen). You can use your Pixel 6 to charge them.

# Connection Issues

I didn't have connection issues for now.

# Is it worth the upgrade ?

I was particularly afraid about the Buds was not secure at all, large that you can't lay down with them and that I will keep the Series A in this cases. But I was completely wrong. I can get rid off my Series A, get rid off the little pain in my ears and give it to my family. So, in my opinion they are worth and also because you can control the volume using the touch control. I will not make a Youtube video about them because I don't have the confidence for it, I let all experimented Youtubers do it when they can.

If you are in low budget, you can still get the Series A, they are really great too.

That's what I tested with the Buds Pro, I hope that helps you to choose if you want to keep your first version, your Series A or if you want to upgrade it. Excuse my English too, I'm doing my best for you beside I'm French.I'm gonna enjoy them for a while now ! If you need more pictures, more samples, or others questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment.

It should do much much more, I hope google revamp it to utilize the dead space it creates on the right as well as add many more customizations that also apply to the lock screen and AOD.

Edit: typo"
GooglePixel,Had a chance to mess around with the pixel 4 xl for a few hours. Here are my thoughts.,"Smooth motion is great, but you still notice the usual Android stutterness (is better overall due to the higher refresh rate) 

To be honest, I'm a huge high refresh pixel peeping human, and if anyone was wanting to upgrade to this phone based on that feature alone, I would reconsider. 

Motion sense is gimmicky sure, but works flawlessly and I can see myself just doing this on drives (even though I can just press the button on the steering wheel). It's cool 😎 Motion sense does work with the screen off (I had ambient display on during my testing).

Motion sense also works great for checking phone status (like the moto phones from back in the day).

Motion sense also has a nice sleek animation when it's activated (you can see it on the top bar if you view the video).

Oled was on the warmer side, didn't test for black crush. Hopefully it's better with burn in VS my current pixel 3.
Didn't seem that much brighter at max brightness vs my pixel 3. Maybe 50nits?

Works with the pixel stand just like the pixel 3.

Felt like initially setting up face unlock was a bit harder than needed. Seems to be really picky about how you tilt your head. Works flawlessly and is so much faster than face unlock on the iPhone.

One thing that was quite annoying (for me) is that you'll either need to press the power button or wake up the phone (via motion sense, lift to wake, double tap) to activate faceunlock. I did manage to get this to work via just the ambient display and looking straight at it, but was incredibly inconsistent. I can see why this would not be an option due to accidental unlocks.

Camera honestly looks the same to me VS the p3 (sorry no samples). Front facing is wider by default (p3 slightly wider), but honestly good enough. No wide angle for the back camera (already confirmed I think). Didn't test video (sorry).

Build quality is solid. Best hardware by Google so far on these phones. 
The extra 2 gigs of ram is really helpful. Thank you Google lol. Performance is what you'd expect (smooth at launch, hopefully it stays that way). I'm looking at you Google.

Speakers sounded better to me vs my P3. Take that with a grain of salt though, everyone's ears are different.

Didn't test the haptics everyone sorry! Pretty sure it was turned off ;__;

Final thoughts. Doesn't feel like a necessary upgrade if you already own a pixel 3. I'll be upgrading  due to my dad needing a new phone, but otherwise I'd wait for the 5 or a nice sale! OG users, upgrade away. P2 users, maybe wait for a sale too, but if you need a new phone asap and you want a pixel, upgrade away.

Edited: No comment on the battery. Had it for a short duration.

Edited: Squeeze is there, and it felt better to me vs my 3.

If there are any other specific questions, let me know.

GooglePixel,"Exclusive: Pixel will be able to stream Android apps to your Chromebook/PC, here’s how it works",
GooglePixel,Google really does have the worst customer service (rant),"I have a Pixel 4 XL that I purchased, new, when it came out last October (it's been in a case since day one, and it has never been dropped).

Back in August, I woke up one morning and saw that the phone hadn't charged (it was on a Pixel Stand).  I thought, ""that's weird,"" and took it off the charger and placed it back on.  Nothing.  I have 8 wireless chargers throughout my house and tried all of them; sometimes the Pixel 4XL would start charging, but within a minute or two would stop, and sometimes it wouldn't start charging at all.  Charging via a USB-C cable plugged into the phone still worked.

I also have an iPhone, so I tried the iPhone on the Pixel Stand and all the other wireless chargers, and it charged on all of them with no issues.  So the issues was definitely the Pixel 4XL, not the chargers.

So I call Google.  Or more accurately, I put in a request to receive a call.  Eventually get connected with someone and I explain the situation, and I ask if I can get a replacement phone sent to me since it's been less than a year and the phone is under warranty.  I am told no, that is not an option, and that the only option available to me is to go to a physical Ubreakifix location.  I explain to the guy that we are in the middle of a pandemic and that I would feel safe if Google could send me a replacement phone (I told him I'm fine with Google taking my credit card number in case I don't send the malfunctioning one back).  He says no, my only option is to physically take the phone in.  I ask if I have to take it in that day or if I can wait, and he said he'll create a case/claim for me and that I can take it in anytime.  I ask him if it'll still be valid if I wait to take it in until it's safer, even if it's after the warranty expires.  He says yes.  I triple check and ask him if I wait until November or December and take it in if it will still be valid for repair/replacement, and he says yes.

So I wait.  And the pandemic situation does not improve.  So I keep waiting.

Yesterday, I decide that despite the pandemic, I will try taking it to the Ubreakifix store.  I go there, and  after speaking with the guy who works there, he says he can't find any case/claim for me.  He looks it up by IMEI, my phone number, and my name.  Nothing.  He says I have to call Google.

So I come home, request another call from Google, and it says I will get a call in less than a minute.  15 minutes later, I get a call saying that they can't take any calls, goodbye.  WTF.  So I wait until today.  I make another request to get a call from Google.  It says I will get a call in less than a minute.  17 minutes later, still no call, so I try submitting another request.  They say a request already exists.  After 35 minutes, I finally get a call with a message saying that someone is on the line ready to talk to me.  *Another* 32 minutes later, someone finally comes on the line.

I explain everything to her and she asks what I was doing when the issue first happened.  I ask her if there are any notes from the first time I called back in August, and she says that there are, but that she wants updated information.  What?  If she can read what I was doing when it first happened, how could I update her on what I was doing when it first happened?  So I tell her the same thing, and she says I was offered a replacement back in August.  What?!?  I tell her it makes no sense that I would be offered a free replacement, would then *decline* that free replacement, continue to live with a malfunctioning phone, and then call back 4 months later to request that same free replacement.  She says she understands and will update the notes.

She then says she's going to put me on hold to see what the options are, since the warranty has expired.  Then the call disconnects.

She had taken my number at the beginning of the call so she can call me back if the call gets disconnected.  It's now been over 30 minutes and no callback.

Fuck Google.

# UPDATE

Firstly, thank you to all those with sympathetic words and for sharing your Google support stories, good and bad.  Secondly, thanks for the award! Thirdly, here is what has gone on since I posted this yesterday:

OK, so after posting this, I continued doing research online, and came across this page (about 30 minutes before another Redditor replied to my post with the same link, thank you to whomever that was!) on Google's support site about an extended repair program specifically for the Pixel 4 XL and power/charging/battery issues: [1-year extended repair program for Pixel 4 XL](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10169830?hl=en&ref_topic=7223822)

(As an aside, interestingly enough, if you take the title of the Google support page, ""1-year extended repair program for Pixel 4 XL"" and do a Google search for it, at least the first 50 results do not have that page as a result (I stopped clicking through after the 5th page).  Coincidence?  🤷🏻‍♂️🤔🤨🧐😏)

From that page: ""To check if your Pixel 4 XL is eligible for repair, you can bring your device to the nearest uBreakiFix location""  Which pisses me off.  Firstly, why didn't the Google support person I spoke with back in August tell me about this?  Secondly, why didn't the Google support person I spoke with two days ago tell me about this?  Thirdly, why didn't the Ubreakifix person tell me about this two days ago?

So I call the Ubreakifix store and talk to someone different and ask about this program specifically, and am told, ""oh yeah, Google has this program for the Pixel 4 XL.""  When I ask why the other Ubreakifix employee didn't tell me about this, he says he doesn't know.  I give him my IMEI number, he looks it up, and says it qualifies (obviously, since it's a one-year extension on a one-year warranty, and every Pixel 4 XL in existence is less than two years old).  So I go back to the Ubreakifix store, and he says it might just be a loose glass back because of faulty adhesive.  He says I have to come back the next day.

I go back today evening and he tells me it's actually a swollen battery which caused the glass back to rise *just* enough that it's not visible to the eye but the wireless charging contacts were not... making contact.  He said that while he sees battery swelling in Samsung phones the most, he does rarely see it on Pixel phones and iPhones.  They try to charge me $60 for the repair, even though they had confirmed yesterday that it would be covered.  So I had to explain again that it was covered, they had to check with a manager, etc... and quickly gave the phone to me without me having to pay.

In the meanwhile, after posting this yesterday and taking my phone in to Ubreakifix, I get one email yesterday and another one this afternoon from Google.  Yesterday's was from some generic Google support person, and this afternoon's was from the person I spoke with yesterday when our call got ""disconnected"".  She only tried to reach out to me, more than 24 hours after our call got disconnected, and after I found that extended repair program on my own, and took the phone in to Ubreakifix.  Both of those emails were saying they needed more information to process a review of my case for the ""Advanced Hardware Support"" team.  🙄 Still zero mention of the extended repair program.

Still, fuck Google."
GooglePixel,Yet Another Pixel 5 Review - from a long time Pixel user.,"If you had asked me 2 weeks ago whether or not I was considering purchasing a Pixel 5, I would have said no. There was nothing wrong with my Pixel 4 XL, and nothing about the 5 has jumped out at me as being a 'must have' feature.

But I walked into a local tech retailer and they had a big display set up for them. I had a play around on the demo unit - and long story short I ended up buying one.

For context, my history with the Nexus/Pixel line: Nexus 4 > Nexus 5 > Nexus 6p > Pixel 2 XL > Pixel 4 XL > Pixel 5.

Here are my unbiased, unabashed thoughts after using the Pixel 5 for just under a week, which are largely going to be framed with comparison to the Pixel 4 XL.

**BUILD QUALITY**

I love the feel of the Pixel 4 XL. I'm also terrified of using it without a case because of the copious amounts of glass and scratch-prone aluminium that surrounds it. Even though I wanted to use it naked, I kept a case on it 90% of the time.

The size of the P5 feels great in the hand - its small, but not cripplingly so, and feels safe to use without a case. The texture of the 'bio-resin' finish is pretty unique, and to be honest I'm not 100% sure if I like it or not yet, but it's grippy, doesn't scratch, and from what I can tell, is easy to clean.

The flat glass on the front is a welcome addition, and everything about the handset seems to fit together well. There aren't any gaps, the buttons don't wobble - basically, no complaints.

**DISPLAY**

The P4XL's display is fantastic. Probably the best I've seen on any device so far. After a few days on the P5, I can say that the screen is good, but not as good as the P4XL's. While the displays are similar, the higher PPI on the P4XL screen makes it look that little bit sharper when compared side to side.

That said, the difference is *only* stark when compared side by side. For daily use it won't matter. The P5's display is not at all poor, it's just not as good as it could be.

The smooth display also works well. This feature was also on the P4XL and it worked well there too, so there's not much to say about this. It's there, it works, it's good.

All that having been said, the P5's display gets extra points because of the way that they've utilised the ENTIRE front of the phone, rather than having uneven bezels. Much of this is due to them doing away with Project Soli, but I could count on one hand the number of times I actually made use of that on the P4XL, so I'm not losing any sleep over it.

**PERFORMANCE**

This was the big question mark I had for the P5, given Google's choice to revert to the SD765G. I'm a medium to heavy user. I make a reasonable number of calls each day, I use FB/Reddit/Instagram/Snapchat, play the occasional game, and lean on my phone heavily for photos, and the editing of said photos.

In short, I can barely tell the difference between the P4XL and P5. The only area in which I've noticed a significant difference is the processing of photos, due to the P5 not having the Neural Core that was in the P4XL for dedicated image processing. We're not talking having to wait forever, but in my side by side tests, the P4XL would process in 1-2 seconds what the P5 takes sometimes 3-5 seconds to process.

Some apps take ever so slightly longer to load on the P5, and I've had to restart the phone once because something weird happened and everything froze up, but apart from that it's been smooth as butter. 

It's worth noting that there have been a few moments where, under heavy use, the handset starts to get warm, where I never had any such issue on the P4XL.

**BATTERY**

So, full disclosure, battery life is never really a big deal to me. My home desk has a wireless charger, my work desk has a wireless charger, my car has a USB charger...basically I'm never far from power if needed. BUT...

Battery is where the P5 is beginning to shine. This thing just goes and goes and goes. I realise I'm still in the first week of use, so the performance will degrade slightly, but the P5 has a noticeably and significantly longer battery life than any other phone I've ever used. 

I had it on my bedside table playing videos when I went to bed last night, and have been using it for work this morning. My SoT on this charge is currently sitting at 2hrs 45mins, and the battery is at 84%. It hasn't been on charge since around 8:30pm last night.

This is with everything set up pretty much as default. Smooth display on, auto brightness, all notifications on. Not much else to say, battery is great.

**CAMERA**

Here's the big one. To cut right to the chase, I think the P4XL's camera is better.

Obviously with the P5, you have the advantage of the wide angle lens, which you don't get and can't replicate on the P4XL, but then you miss out on the telephoto lens with the P5. For which one is better - it really depends on which lens you think you'll get more use out of.

The P5 camera is fine. For 95% of people it'll do the job and produce really great looking photos, especially in well-lit environments. However as soon as I took side by side photos with the P4XL, there was just a bit more clarity, sharpness and (in my opinion) better balance in the P4XL's photos.

Again though, this is largely going to be a case of whether or not you prefer a Telephoto or Wide-angle lens. 

One last thing - if you're concerned about video, the P5 is the winner hands down. The P4XL's video is pretty average. The P5's 4k60 recording, and features like cinematic pan and the plethora of stabilisation options offer a much better video experience.

**MISC**

A few comments on things that didn't really fit into other categories.

* I much prefer the fingerprint sensor over face unlock. The sensor is in a spot that just makes so much sense, and it feels comfortable. It's also lightning quick every time, where sometimes the face unlock wouldn't recognise me.

* I'm not a huge fan of the vibrating-under-the-glass speaker setup. It works well enough, but I don't think it's as loud as the normal speaker on the P4XL.

* The size is really interesting. I was prepared to dislike the P5 immediately because I was used to a much bigger phone, but the reality is that due to the way they utilise the space on the screen (ie. no bezels), the screen itself isn't THAT much smaller, despite the phone itself having a much smaller footprint.

**SO AM I KEEPING IT, OR GOING BACK TO THE P4XL?**

Honestly, I don't know yet. The P5 has a lot going for it, despite the naysaying from much of the community and vocal critics.

It has drawbacks, sure, but for what you're paying, I'm not sure they're really going to be the end of the world - for transparency, I paid $990 AUD for the P5, and $650 AUD for the P4XL (I exploited a limited time offer one of our providers was offering on the P4 line in anticipating of the P5 release).

The more I use the P5, the more I am coming to like the form factor, the feel, and especially the display. Words cannot express how much zero bezels makes a difference.

I still have two and a half weeks before I need to make a final decision, but at this point if I had to choose, I'd probably sacrifice the few aspects of the P4XL that are superior in favour of the excellent design and overall feel of the P5.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far - happy to answer any questions you might have!"
GooglePixel,January 2020 Android Security Update Now Available for Pixel Devices,
GooglePixel,Those that have ordered - ignore the naysayers and enjoy your phone,"I'm still enjoying a Pixel 2 XL, which if you'll rewind a couple of years was getting shat on left right and center for all manner of reasons. Some justified, some not so much.

What I can tell you is that 2 years on, my 2 XL is the best phone I've ever owned, despite what this sub would have had you believe at time of release.

It's a Pixel, so:

- It's already running Android 10 and is smoother and faster than ever for it.
- The camera still bests or equals most of what is out there today.
- In spite of temptation, the experience is still so good that I'm still not tempted to upgrade (prior to this phone I've been upgrading every year since before smartphones were even a thing). Will probably wait until P4XL is cheaper next year, or may even wait it out until P5.

Enjoy your new phones everyone."
GooglePixel,Ugh Pixel Stolen By Shipper,"My fiance pre-ordered a Pixel 4a, he is not the type to spend money idly but he's having problems with his current phone and it doesn't take very good photos. Being the Google-phile that I am, I suggested the Pixel 4a, I know it will take great photos and provide him with smooth user experience. He was so excited to get his new phone, we waited quite a while but today was the day. To be honest, I was excited too, I've never owned a Pixel myself and wanted to see how the user experience stacked up against my S10 Plus. Well he opens the box only to find out that there is no phone inside, just the adapters, and cables. The shipping box looks to have been retaped and the Pixel box's seals have been cut. This indicates to us that the phone was stolen during shipping, apparently this isn't the first time this has happened, as there are a couple of posts elsewhere on Reddit detailing similar experiences. He's on the phone with Google's customer support right now so hopefully we can get this resolved in a timely manner. Will update you guys when it's all resolved. I just feel really bad for him right now and wanted to vent. Thanks for listening.

&#x200B;

Update: My fiance is finally off the phone will Google with no real resolution, they said they will conduct an investigation that's going to take between 24-48 hours to complete. They wanted him to send over some information on the box.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just want to thank everyone for all of the advice and supportive comments, it's definitely made us feel better. We will be reaching out to other outlets as soon as possible. "

So it does appear as though a fix could be on the horizon - I've accepted their offer for the beta OTA so hopefully we shall know soon enough."
GooglePixel,Locked folder coming to Google Photos on Pixels,
GooglePixel,Google Pixel 5 leaked in full hours ahead of launch event,
GooglePixel,Idea: Google Assistant 'Photographer Mode',"How often do you prop your phone up on a rock, chair or other apparatus and use the timer function on your camera to take a photo? I do, quite a bit. As a Pixel owner, I'm usually the one designated to take the group photos when with friends.

Doing this a few times, and always having to run back and forth to my phone to see if (1) the photo was taken (it's often hard to hear when with a noisy bunch) and (2) if everyone had their eyes open, has given rise to an idea that I think, potentially, Google would really like given that the two main selling points of the Pixel line are the camera and the Google Assistant.

What if Google Assistant got a ""photographer mode""? Imagine this:

Me: ""Hey Google, be my photographer.""

Pixel: ""Sure, I'll be your photographer!""

(At this point, GA opens my camera and uses all the Google machine learning smarts to analyze what it sees. If it seems that people are not all in frame, or someone's head is being cut off, it offers verbal feedback)

Pixel: ""I need you guys to scooch in a bit, you're not all in frame yet.""

(Once it sees everyone in frame, it snaps a shot)

Pixel: ""That was a good one! Let's try another one, okay? Are you ready?""

(Snaps another photo)

Pixel: ""I think we got it! Do you want to take another one just in case?""

Me: ""No thanks!""

Pixel: ""No problem"" (Exists ""photography mode"").

I know this could be considered pretty advanced, but to be honest I don't see why Google can't start doing something like this with what they already have. I mean, you can already ask the assistant to take photo. It's more just the fact that you always have to take at least 2-3 photos to get a good one, right?

I don't know, I may be way off, but come one, I think this would be a killer feature! Who agrees?"
GooglePixel,The Pixel 2 is the best phone I've used to date,"The past week or so I went through 3 new phones, all of which were so broken they were sent back the same day we got them. Then I suggested a Google Pixel phone because a friend suggested it and we scoured eBay and found one we could collect the same day. We found a Pixel 2 for £140 and we thought we may as well give it a shot.

Oh my god. I'm only on the second day of using it and I'm already in love with it. The phone is super fast even when running a demanding game, the fingerprint scanner is in a convenient location, the camera is crystal clear especially for 2019 and the battery life is really good

It is seriously the best phone I have ever put my hands on and it makes me sad I didn't invest in Google Pixel at first. Needless to say I am now commited to Pixel and I love Google even more

EDIT: This got more upvotes than I expected and I'm kinda surprised. Thanks to everyone for all the comments it makes me feel not alone. I'm steadily falling in love with my phone more and more"

GooglePixel,"6/6 pro owners that use fingerprint unlock--how many times a day do you experience where you have to enter your PIN, with the notification that ""the phone has been locked manually""?","On my 6 pro it happens at least 6-12 times a day.  The message wording bugs me (""locked manually""--no, no I did not manually lock it), but this happens far more frequently than any of my previous pixels.  Is there something I can look into?

Edit--I don't have a screen protector installed, and my FP scanning has not been problematic at all on my phone.  Just to be absolutely clear, it's not because my FP scanner cannot scan my finger properly; mine has been very reliable and i haven't had issues with it being slow.  This is the ""pin needed for extra security"" that previous versions of Android would call it.  I do use trusted devices, as others have mentioned maybe that's a place to look into."

Consider twice where you buy your phone as Google absolutely doesn't care about customer service as it has proven time and time again...

I know a lot of you will say, that this is a useless exercise, however I do think that feedback from the hundreds of comments on this thread is valuable to companies like Google and for sure they have managers monitoring social media for posts like this, so don't feel like you are screaming into the void.

GooglePixel,Trade-in phone value reduced from $240 to $37,"Update: I will receive the full refund, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/l257s7/update_about_my_pixel_2_tradein_240_to_37_reduced/).

[I posted this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/88elad/status/1351220733695959044), but I think I should also post this here.

On Black Friday weekend there were aggressive advertisements suggesting to trade-in a phone and get a Pixel 4a 5G for a reduced price. In my case, it said that for my Pixel 2 128GB, I would get a refund of $240. I read on this subreddit warnings that said that Google might lower the value of the phone with no reason and that this would be non-negotiable, but I didn't believe this would actually happen. 3 years ago I traded-in a Nexus 5X for my Pixel 2 128GB and got the full refund ($115).

Last Wednesday I received an email saying that my phone value has been reduced to $37. It said that they found at least one issue that affects the value of the phone. However, they reported that the phone turns on, the screen has no cracks, and that it has been factory reset. I contacted their support team in order to understand what is the issue. This morning I received an email saying that the phone screen doesn't turn on and that the ports of the were damaged. I replied with a video which I took right before sending the phone, showing it turning on. I also sent the phone in the box in which I received the Pixel 4a 5G for extra protection, to avoid damage to it on the way. Unfortunately, I didn't take a video of the phone charging, so I can't prove that the ports weren't damaged, but you can see in the video (on Twitter) that the phone is fully charged. The support team offered me $50 in Google Store credit, which I refused to accept.

This is a shame, I never imagined any thing like this happening, and this is probably going to be the last Google phone I'll ever own. For those of you who are considering Google's trade-in plans, I would strongly suggest to avoid them."

GooglePixel,Pixel 5 . It's been awesome!,"I've had the pixel 5 since it came out here in the US. Just wanted to say I am completely satisfied and happy with the device. That's it, we tend to always write about the bad things but never the good. So here I am, saying it's been all good, no problems or anything."
GooglePixel,Android watch ecosystem really needs a Google Pixel Watch. My Samsung Galaxy Watch Active died today and I looked for something new and it honestly doesn't seem like anything has changed in the last couple of years.,"I bought a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active a couple of years ago because my Pebble was showing its age and Rebble wasn't cutting it anymore. I just wanted something waterproof, lasts at least 2-3 days, easy to use, and gives me notifications. I'm probably easier to please when it comes to features than most people. It did the job just fine imo.

It died recently, the screen just wont turn on. I decide to look at my options and it honestly feels like the same exact things are on the market...and they're all mediocre. I can't stomach spending another $150 to buy the same exact watch that barely lasted 2 years. Its $200 for the Galaxy Watch Active 2 but even then...$200 bucks doesn't seem worth it for something that I really just mean to buy as a stopgap before I buy the ""unicorn Pixel watch"". Fitbit's offerings are mediocre for the price. IMO Apple is eating everyone's lunch because there's no real alternative to it on the Android side...unless you totally buy into Samsung's ecosystem."
GooglePixel,S10 review from Pixel user,"Would there be any interest in a review on the s10 from a frequent Pixel user?

I know a lot of us are frustrated by the latest bugs as well as the lackluster delivery of the 3. And although the March update had fixed many issues I feel many of us are looking to test the waters on other devices.

I'm no MKBHD, but I have used all 3 Pixel devices, having been consistently on Pixel since my 2XL. I've also tested the 3XL against the iPhone XS Max and Note 9 previously. So now having an opportunity to test the S10+ I have the chance to give an honest review from a Pixel user perspective.

Would anyone be interested in a full review? I just received mine yesterday so it would be at least a week or more to get the full experience.

TLDR; I'm a full time Pixel user with an S10+ and want to do a review.

EDIT: Since this post is starting to really gain traction, are there any areas that you guys would like to focus on? The main areas I'm planning on currently are: screen, camera, battery, UI, customization, settings, performance (this will include speed, memory leaks, apps force closing, and responsiveness), Samsung vs Google apps (such as pay, bixby, etc), and general impressions.

I'll test anything you guys are interested in knowing.

EDIT2: Damn this post has really blown up. I won't let you guys down. I'm expecting to write the review by or around next Saturday. Since I'm a heavy user I expect to have a good idea by then. I'll update this post with a link to the review once it's done. Thanks to everyone for the encouragement and support. Nice to know a lot of people feel the same as me.

GooglePixel,OG Pixel Unlimited Photos Storage: Syncthing Guide,"With June around the corner, millions of users will lose access to unlimited High Quality Photos storage. If you have an OG Pixel or are willing to spare double-digits dollars, you can easily sync your new phone's captures to your old Pixel for unlimited backup at Original Quality. Below I'll describe how I use [Syncthing-Fork](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid) to automatically and instantly sync photos with insignificant battery drain. We'll also touch on battery maintenance for the OG Pixel, such as cycling the battery with a smart plug, [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm), and [AutoInput](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoinput).

---

#Installation and Folder Selection 

[Syncthing-Fork](https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android) is a ""Syncthing Wrapper for Android."" I originally used the official app but battery drain was consistently high and the connection was not stable. The fork resolved both issues for me. Install Syncthing-Fork on both phones so we can select the relevant folders. 

Open the app and hit `Menu (☰) > Web GUI > + Add Folder > General`. 

* `Label` your folder whatever, e.g. ""Camera""
* `Path` to the relevant folder, e.g. `/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera` 

Go to the `Ignore Patterns` tab to exclude things. I don't sync thumbnails (high frequency changes) or photos queued for deletion (unimportant) and input `*thumbnail*` and `*trashed*` on separate lines in the text box. You may also add paths to subdirectories that should be ignored, such as `Messenger`. Note the operator guide under the text field.

Finally, go to the `Advanced` tab:

* `Type` as ""Send Only"" so external devices can't modify your new phone's files
* `Pull order` ""Oldest First"" because ??? This is unimportant because syncing occurs so frequently that your pool is only 1-2 items. 
* `Save`

Repeat the above steps for additional folders except do not repeat individual `Ignore Patterns` because we can do it globally later. Finish adding your folders. Remember that subfolders ARE included. Each sync'd folder will contain `.stfolder` and other `.stremoved*` files. Removing these files will break your sync. To fix, simply replace the removed file with one of the same name. Learn more about ignoring files [here](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/ignoring.html).

I sync the following folders

* `/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera`
* `/storage/emulated/0/Movies/`
* `/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/`

If you created a folder and specified `Ignore patterns`, you should have a '.stignore' file in your `/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera` folder. Copy that to your root direction (e.g. `/storage/emulated/0/`). Open `.stignore` with a text editor and it should look like this:

> `**.thumbnails`  
> `(?d)**thumbnail**`  
> `**.trashed*`    
> `**.tmp`

Right now, it will ignore any files and folders with those terms in their names. Please modify however you want per the linked documentation above. Include directories with respect to the root directory (e.g. `!(?d)/Movies/Messages`).

#Syncing to OG Pixel

On your new phone, `Syncthing-Fork > Menu (☰) > Show device ID`. On your OG Pixel, `Syncthing-Fork > Devices (tab) > Add Device (top right)`. Tap the QR code button to scan your new phone.

* `Name` it whatever
* `Introducer` enabled because your new phone will introduce stuff
* I think there was an accept all folders options, or maybe it was in the GUI, Idr.
* Go to Web GUI

I kinda ran out of steam for this section so ask in the comments if you have trouble. The GUI is pretty straightforward so you should get the hang of it by now.

#Battery Health Maintenance

Chargie is one option. Kinda pricey, would not recommend.

The absolutely best method requires you have a bootloader unlocked OG Pixel so you can install [acc by VR25](https://github.com/VR-25/acc/releases) alongside [AccA by MatteCarra](https://github.com/MatteCarra/AccA/releases). This method will allow you to directly power the device and bypass the battery entirely. If the device loses power, it will revert to battery. Unfortunately my version is from Verizon (but was only $60 mint condition) so I had to use Tasker and AutoInput.

Install Tasker/AutoInput, then go through the setup and accessibility and write secure adb stuff. Each app will walk you through how to do it.

Create two Tasker profiles with state = `power` and source = `AC`, and toggle `Invert` for one. First profile is `Invert` and turns on the plug when your battery drops too low. Second profile turns off the plug upon your specified charge level. There's some stuff with AutoInput I'm too lazy to explain at the moment, but here's my tasks ([to turn on charger](https://taskernet.com/shares/?user=AS35m8mGsA8aGfmf4DUXCBRb5YEzCAiP1MgGf5ZDirUBHL9i9OnWONuPxxhrHm%2F5FI%2FS&id=Task%3AAC+Off%2C+%3C30%2C+ON), and [to turn it off](https://taskernet.com/shares/?user=AS35m8mGsA8aGfmf4DUXCBRb5YEzCAiP1MgGf5ZDirUBHL9i9OnWONuPxxhrHm%2F5FI%2FS&id=Task%3AAC+On%2C+%3E70%2C+OFF)). Link your profile active when power is on (AC not Inverted) to the task that turns off when the battery hits 70. Link the Invert profile to the one that turns on when the battery hits 30. I can confirm it will automatically turn off at 70%. I will update if it doesn't turn on or there are any update. Assume the taskernet link is the most up-to-date."
GooglePixel,Android 11 Beta 2 Now Available for Pixel Phones!,

GooglePixel,Hidden Android 11 feature adds double-tap gesture to the back of Pixel phones,
GooglePixel,Pixel 6 Pro don't seem to get the same treatment as other brands.,"TL; DR: S22 series release and reviews made me appreciate my 6 pro even more and start questioning reviewers bias and the state of the smartphones market.

Stay with me, it is a pixel post, although the S22 reviews made me write this.

I've watched a few reviews about the S22 series and they look great, love the matt glass and really wish google did this for the 6 Pro. 

However there's one review I was waiting the most for and that's MKBHD's one. Beautiful videos, lots of details etc and I kind of tend to feel he is not that biased about android brands(under question now).

His S22 review left me with a mixed bag of feelings. Not a single mention of price to specs ratio. You get a 1080p screen, not a LTPO screen, not really a camera upgrade on paper with a marginal actual quality improvement of photos. 

What really annoyed me though was his comment on battery life. 4.5 hours of screen on time in about 29 hours off the charger and he said that's good. I don't know how many of you remember, but his pixel 6 pro got 4-5 hours of SoT and he called it trash, while the phone is 100£ cheaper than the S22+ and you get way better spec on paper and reality. This is not even to mention the fact that I believe he got a lemon as lots of people have great battery life on their 6 pro's and I personally get around 6-7 hours SoT with 30% left before going to bed.

It really bothers me that, because phones are considered flagships, price doesn't matter anymore. How does one justify paying more money, for less specs and does not even mention it. Not even talking about the ultra which is 400£ more and you don't really get anything more apart from the pen (which I think is really cool nonetheless). I feel like price should be important as paying hundreds more for marginal upgrades is crazy. It supports the idea that companies can keep increasing prices, because people will see them as more premium, when in reality it offers barely anything. 

In my opinion Google hit the nail with the pixel 6 series (yes, both the regular and the pro), because I can hardly find a phone nowadays that offers as much as the pixel while still being ""affordable"". Heck, even the ""a"" series are getting a lot better now with the improved design, no compromises on the processor side as well with the Tensor and great cameras. 

To finish this rant - I think major reviewers should consider the price of a phone more, rather than just them being flagships and comparing them all together. There's a huge difference between paying 850 and 1300 for what seems marginally better products."

GooglePixel,Just played with the Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro at Best Buy,"My local Best Buy had the 7 and 7 Pro on display. I was able to spend some time checking them out. Here are my thoughts and things to note. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to help. For comparison I cannot comment on how they compare to the 6 and 6 Pro in terms of camera and performance, considering I only had my 4 XL on me. I was unable to test anything battery, or unlocking wise.

**Design/Hardware**

Both devices are nice, and feel premium. I was a tad underwhelmed though, because they seem very similar to the 6 & 6 Pro devices. The size of the 7 feels perfect, and I much prefer the flat display. The 7 Pro curved sides have been reduced from the 6 Pro last year so that's a good improvement. The Obsidian/black model was the only one on display. It picks up a lot of fingerprints, and feels like the same finish as the 6 series. I'll be curious how the Snow and Hazel colors compare. The 7 camera bar and side rails are matte, which I prefer. The 7 Pros looks nicer, but it's glossy which isn't for me. 

**Display**

Both devices are very bright. For the limited time I spent, I couldn't notice a quick difference between the 120 hz and 90 hz screens. 

**Camera** 

The 7 Pro selfie cam gives you a wider angle than the 7. The back camera can zoom in much further. On the 6 Pro I had owned, I often had issues with low light on the selfie camera. The processing would make you look like a water color painting. I'm a tad worried that the 7 and 7 Pro is using the same selfie camera, and will have the same issue. I could only test this in the store, so I do not know forsure how selfie photos will look in bad lighting situations. But from what I was able to capture, the selfies did not seem super sharp. I'd expect in sun light they will look very good as they have in the past. For the Macro Focus mode, I was unable to figure out how to use that on the 7 Pro. There wasn't anything obvious that said Macro in the camera app. I thought by focusing on something up close with the ultrawide lens would allow me to do that, but no help there. One thing I did notice as an upgrade from the 6 Pro to the 7 Pro, was on the 6 Pro as you zoom in on a subject, you could really notice when the camera switched from the main lens to the telephoto. On the 7 Pro, the switching of the lens is a lot more smooth, and less noticeable.


**Conclusion** The Pixel 7 ultimately is the better value. I'm someone who really cares about the camera specs, but for the 7 Pro you're essentially paying $300 for a telephoto lens, more RAM, and a larger battery. So if those matter to you, and you don't mind the 6.7 in display, then go for the Pro.

Something I'm also realizing with Pixels, is that unless you're upgrading to a device with major hardware upgrades, you're going to have a very similar experiences, since the software is so consistent and we all get software upgrades. I'd imagine iPhone users have similar experiences. If you want something that really feels new, then I'm starting to realize you're better off switching OS's or manufacturers.

What I'll be most curious from reviews are, do the overheating issues still exist, how's the battery, how's the face unlock compared to the Pixel 4, and has the fingerprint scanner improved at all.

GooglePixel,"Took years for my brother to try a Pixel phone, took 3 days for him to return it.","I've been a long time Pixel user, always told my brother (who's not into phones or tech at all) about the cool features Pixel phones had, the camera etc. He's always been a Samsung user, but he finally decided to check out the 6 Pro.

In three days he told me he's had multiple calls drop out, issues with the Pixel Stand 2 constantly asking him to realign the phone, the phone freezing on him and a couple of random reboots, the fingerprint is slow and doesn't read occasionally. This is all after the January patch has been installed. Then he looks online and finds out there's a tonne of people having the same issues he has and told me jokingly I made him buy a dud phone. I said there's been issues and Google are trying to fix them, but the issues he has been getting are serious and probably better just to go with a phone he hasn't had issues with.

He's has contacted Google and initiated return. I can't blame him.

This launch has really been a disaster for Google. If they wanted to make a push for more causal users to buy the phone, you can't have a product with this many serious issues. Consumers aren't just going to put up with it.

I myself am looking to move off the Pixel 6 Pro when the Galaxy S22U comes out. I like the phone, but with all the bugs, I'm not going to wait for Google to sort it all out."
GooglePixel,Does anyone actually miss the squeeze feature?,"I recently installed custom rom on my pixel 3 and there was an [Customize the squeeze (active edge)](https://i.imgur.com/qkfXHTm.jpg) to other options and I thought that it was really cool and underrated what developers could do , which google only gave us one option, I'm not saying squeeze to assistant is bad but if we had other options like this it would have been really useful."
GooglePixel,"Google should allow third party Icon Packs in their launcher, since they made other launchers somewhat unsuable.","I really like(d) to customize my homescreen and sadly (even though Google says different) it is getting worse with every new android version. 
Since the gesture came out, you are basically stuck with the default launcher if you want to use them fluidly which, in googles case, doesn't allow for other icon packs.
Since android 12, you can't even customize the shape of the icons anymore. That is probably the least way that I can customize my homescreen since whatever Android version.
I really like Monet and also the new icon designs however, it's only supported by some Google apps which makes it somewhat more ugly if a few apps are themed and the others are birght and have completely different colors. (An option that forces the other app icons to also adapt to the theme would be nice, I think that is even possible, since the adaptive Icons already have an icon in 2 layers).

But whatever, most of this would be fixed if Google allows for icon packs on the Pixel Launcher. I wouldn't need a third party launcher anymore, I could change the icon shape with an icon pack, and I could use an icon pack that uses Monet.

I have send feedback to the Pixel Launcher for years that they should add, but obviously they haven't. (They actually removed the feedback option lol).

Edit: 
Yes the gesture do work TECHNICALLY on other launchers. BUT the implementation is still far from as good as on the Pixel Launcher. There is always a small input lag after closing an app, before you can open another. The animation is somewhere where the icon is, but is still separate while the Pixel Launcher basically includes the app icon into the animation. It is still sometimes buggy, has some lag, doesn't work good with rotation.
I think it also depends on how fast and how often you open close apps, how detailed you look an animations and so on, if you find the third party gestures enough for you or not. But it is still not the same as the Pixel Launcher which I think it should be for a good experience."

GooglePixel,Don't kill Project Soli,"Project Soli is one of the coolest projects Google has created in the past decade. You can see how long the project team has been working on it from the videos on YouTube. It's been rumored that Project Soli will not be on the Pixel 5 line, and while that makes sense for now while it feels a little gimmicky, I implore Google to continue looking at the possibilities of this project. Putting a chip like this on a watch would be useful especially because watch screens aren't very large. Allowing other developers to play with the possibilities of this chip would also be great."
GooglePixel,"I tracked the amount of time it took to charge the new pixel buds from ~empty to full, here is the result!","[Plots](https://i.imgur.com/moMvli0.png)

I let the buds drain; this resulted in the right bud draining to empty while a the left bud still had 10%.  I then put them in the charging case and tracked the charge status at 1 minute intervals for the first 10 minutes, then every 5 minutes until the buds reached around 80%, then every minute after that.

* **They get about 20% charge in the first 5 minutes!!**  Then about 40% within the first 10 minutes.  This really is in line with Google's claim of 2h of use with 10 minutes of charge.


* From 0% to 100% took 47 minutes


* They charge most-rapidly up until about 80%, then charge rate levels off reaching 100%


* The case lost 18% to charge both buds back up, it should provide 5 full charges to the buds

The buds charge seriously fast.  Compared to my Galaxy buds it's not even a competition.

What is also interesting to note from this data is the discrepancy of power use between the buds.  I posted a thread yesterday about drain after an hour of use, and there was a 20% difference between the buds after an hour.  I guess this evens out over longer usage.

At the same time, with one bud dying and the other still having 10% left, you don't get the full usage out of them, which is a bit frustrating as a consumer.  On the other hand, personally, I never really use headphones for more than maybe 2 hours straight, and the fast charge rate means I never really have to worry about them (I don't know how long it took to drain, I just set them to play when going to bed and came back to them in the morning; on retrospect I wish I had set them to play back with long video, then I'd know how long it took based on where the video paused at...)."

Super smooth, great battery life, perfect size, best screen design (screen to body ratio). Display is great and camera is awesome like the old ones. 
I read about speaker sounding bad for phone calls but sounds awesome to me for voice. 
Not really sure I have anything bad to say here. I though I would not be happy since it wasn't 865 but you can't tell that either. I thought haptics are bad but they are ok. Maybe Pixel 3 like.

GooglePixel,Pixel 3 Camera Comparison with iPhone 11 Pro,"[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/baVDP7w)

[Higher quality photos, more night photos, plus an example of the ultrawide iPhone camera.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oaZE8iBk7o8SDkUQ8) I may add more, subscribe and hit the notification bell to be notified if I do!

My Takeaways:

* The iPhone still can't match the Pixel when it comes to fine details like hair/fur/skin, nor can it freeze motion as well. Freezing motion is critical for taking photos of your kids.
* The Pixel struggles to grab focus in the dark, the iPhone doesn't hesitate.
* The iPhone still has a weird brown/orange hue to photos, but not as bad as previous models.
* The iPhone still overexposes, and really lacks contrast/shadows. It just kind of blanket brightens the entire image which makes it look washed out.
* The Pixel's front camera is a lot better than the iPhone's, particularly in handling dynamic range.
* Pixel night photos look more natural to me, the iPhone seems to just max out the sharpening slider which results in more detail but looks really bizarre. Very Samsungish.
* The iPhone's ultrawide camera is bad. Super soft even in the best lighting, looks like a potato in the dark.
* The iPhone is obviously more versatile. Better video and more cameras is very useful.

I really hope Apple's Deep Fusion can deliver a big jump in detail, because it still just isn't there compared to the Pixel."

GooglePixel,People assume call screening is voicemail,"People hear, 'Hi, the person you are calling' then immediately hang up.

Talked to some people who hung up on call screening after I found out they were legitimate calls, turns out they thought it was voicemail.

Anyone else had similar experiences?

Edit: lots of people slagging it off and calling it useless I legitimately want feedback from people who USE it 😶
Thanks to the few who have said that they have had people think it was their voicemail, the ones proposing solutions and the ones getting different outcomes!"
GooglePixel,"""Read this page"" is brilliant","I just squeezed and asked my pixel to 'read this page'. It read for 20 odd minutes with an uncannily natural voice that had intonations matching the structure of the sentences. Not perfect but good enough I initially thought it might have been prepared earlier. Oh and it also tells you how long there is to go, let's you press on any word and have it pick up from there, and continues when you lock the phone. Worth a look if you have the need for it or just want to kick back on a long article."
GooglePixel,Just swapped from Note 9 to P3XL. Nothing beats vanilla Android.,"The Note 9 looked like the total over the top, has everything you can imagine, smartphone.  So I bit the bullet and bought one.

It's a good phone.  I haven't used a Samsung since the S6 Edge so I thought I'd give it a try.  I honstely can't dog on it, it's a great device. But.. and it's a big but.. nothing beats vanilla Android.  From the setup of my P3XL I immediately remembered why I love the Pixel series.

GooglePixel,Phone reviewers are out of touch,"Before I pre-ordered my 6a, I did some research to see what reviewers were saying about it. There were some positive written reviews and one or two positive video reviews but there was also a TON of negativity from well respected tech people. Nevertheless, I decided to go through with the purchase since I was getting an insane trade-in value for my 4a 5G and free Pixel Buds A Series on top of that. I have been using the 6a for half the day now and I honestly have no idea why people are critical of it. I love the looks and the sorta sage color is just right IMO. The display isn't high refresh rate but it still looks great with vibrant color. The camera looks great so far. Best of all, it just runs SO MUCH FASTER than my 4a 5G. Everything feels snappier. The only thing I can't really comment on so far is battery life due to limited testing time. 

I honestly think that tech reviews have become so out of touch with what average consumers want and it's really frustrating to see a good phone get such a bad rap for being... Boring I guess? I get that the specs aren't quite as good as the 6 (but honestly they're pretty damn close) but THIS IS A MIDRANGE PHONE. 

Anyways, rant over. Just take these negative reviews with a grain of salt."

GooglePixel,"My continued struggle with Google to get back my $1000 - A Google Customer Service Nightmare, and why I would NEVER buy anything from Google again","A positive outcome was achieved within a day after this post. I have talked about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/n0pifs/update_on_my_refund_issue_with_google_for_my_lost/).

## I have added some updates for people who are suggesting chargebacks as an option, and also for people who think I am being impatient (which is subjective I think), and of course to people who think I am a fraudster. Also, I would like to point out that in no way do I think Google is not within their rights to investigate this, but for me this is more about customer experience, and my confidence in ever again ordering from Google vs any other brand (Amazon for e.g.). This isn't a case of something being delivered by UPS, and me contesting I never received it. The package has not been scanned since it reached UPS. It would require multiple people to screw up at various points to this being delivered to me, yet not reflecting on UPS record.

I ordered a Pixel 5, and UPS apparently lost the shipment. And even though UPS has confirmed that the package never reached me, Google is still refusing to refund my money.

I keep chatting with their team to get my refund. First 2 days, they would just tell me, ""we have escalated this, please wait"", when I would want to speak with the escalation agent, one chat agent told me no, and then disconnected the chat, even without waiting for a reply. Please note that at no point was I ever rude or abusive to anyone. I was slightly irate (rightfully so), but I just wanted some update.

After 2 days, UPS said they lost the package, but Google said they want UPS to complete an investigation before they will refund my money. Even though I as a consumer should not assume any responsibility of a shipping mishap, and the claims process with UPS is Google's job, apparently, Google likes to hold customer's accountable for delivery mishaps and takes zero financial liability.

If they would have just refund my money right away (like most companies would, when they failed to deliver a product), I would have gone and bought a Pixel 5, but now I would never want to deal with Google customer service again. Not only would I not buy a Pixel (or any Android phone), I have already cancelled my Youtube premium and music subscription as well. And also, the cloud infrastructure that I was planning to build (of all my data)

Imagine you ordered something from Uber Eats, and your food is not delivered, and you are hungry, and Uber says they are conducting an investigation before they can refund anything. This is basically just like that. I am out a $1000 dollars and all Google has given me is 1 email per day that ""we are doing everything we can"".

I understand things can go wrong with shipping, I also understand every company has its policies have, but   this is not a repair or a replacement (I can only imagine the horror of dealing with Google if there is ever a hardware issue). This was a case of a complete no show. Google issuing me a refund should not have depended on any investigation. This policy of their is highly unfair to the customers, and as far as I know is unheard of.

Yesterday I even got an email saying it was escalated to the ""highest tier of support"", and I thought wow, something would happen now, but it seems the answer is still the same - waiting for the investigation, and just more apology that they are literally holding my money without interest, for no reason apart from the fact that they don't want to pay me before UPS pays their claim.

I have been a long time Android/Google loyalist, but this ""fuck you"" policy of Google has made me realize why so many prefer Apple over Google. If it wasn't for the amazing products Google engineers make and the maps/asisstant/search/browser sync experience, absolutely no one would even think about buying Google products.

Edit 1: I cannot do a charge back, not unless I want to lose my Google account of more than a decade.

What is the timeline? Am I being just impatient? For people who want to know the exact timelines to understand whether I am being impatient, I guess whether I am being impatient, and how long is long enough is fairly subjective of course. Perhaps I am being unreasonable, or may be not. It all depends on what your experience of shipment generally is, and also how urgent is your requirement. So, I will mention the timeline here, and people can decide whether they think it's reasonable or not. Again, I don't think there is a right answer to this, and depends on each individual. It has been 1.5 weeks since the purchase, 1 week since the latest estimated delivery date, 1 week since the issue was escalated, and a little more than 1 week since UPS had any updates on their tracking. It took Google 3 days to initiate an investigation through UPS. I kept asking them if it is done, and they said it is, but when I would ask UPS, they would say they still haven't received a request for investigation. Now, I understand that UPS investigations take 10 business days, which is 2 weeks. Till now Google has not once confirmed that they will refund my money if the investigation is complete and it is finalized that I never received the phone. I asked them directly 2 times, and both times, all they have said is they will get back once the escalation is done.

Why should Google refund you based on just your word? Agreed, but this wasn't a case of product delivered, but I am contesting it is not. It wasn't even as if UPS just forgot to scan the package at the time of delivery. They haven't scanned it since it reached their warehouse. I agree they still need to do a thorough investigation to find what exactly happened to the package, but it certainly isn't a case of them delivering it, and me saying I haven't received it.

Why do I want a refund and not replacement? Because I would like to go out and buy a phone from somewhere else, and not wait for a replacement to be shipped. At this stage, I don't even want an immediate refund, I just need realistic timelines, so I know that if this is not refunded by my next billing cycle, how will I manage my finances if I buy another phone.

Why did I not buy it from BestBuy or Carrier in the first place if I was in such rush? Because neither of them had the Sorta Sage in stock, and I didn't anticipate that Google would take this long to get me a phone. In retrospect, yes, I would have just gone with the all Black, but at the time, I didn't anticipate this.

For all who are suggesting I am just trying to defraud Google. If even there is a way to defraud a company like Google (it's everywhere), it realistically would have taken a huge coordinated effort to pull something like this off. And all this for a phone??? Well, it's a possibility, but a very unrealistic one."
GooglePixel,"I WON! Pixel 5A had black screen issue, Google refused to honor warranty after uBreakIFix couldn't repair the device after 3 attempts. It would continually display ""Radio Off"" and the phone wouldn't make calls - I wrote a letter to Investor Relations and Tweeted @MadeByGoogle with 0 followers","**Long story short:** if Google tries to fuck you, don't give up.  Their support supervisors don't try to connect the dots on data that you give them.  They don't look at attachments.  They will not talk to you on the phone, either.  There's only Level 1 support by phone, due to an awful system Google intentionally has set up.  The Google Fi doesn't have access to the Pixel resources.  In the letter, you'll see there was like 8-10 supervisor responses, and denial reasons were all over the board.

There's more to the story than what you see in the letter... This is a summary of ""the final phase"" which turned out to be a cluster of back-and-forth and confusion like the other two phases. Yes, there was a Round 1 and Round 2, which I haven't even gone into.  What you see here is 'Round 3' only.

**Solution:** Write a letter to their Investor Relations and tweet u/MadeByGoogle (I have 0 followers and it still got a response).  In less than 24 hours, I got an email today saying ""My name is \_\_\_\_ and I am a higher level specialist that stumbled upon your case during a routine audit.""

**Letter & More Info are Seen here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQMRYHiEsUVnsITX3alXWTQyA\_0dIvzTOfS2ozNNJw1YiNmIFVvltqZfX8FzaTIUx42IuRAA1FRYalf/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQMRYHiEsUVnsITX3alXWTQyA_0dIvzTOfS2ozNNJw1YiNmIFVvltqZfX8FzaTIUx42IuRAA1FRYalf/pub)

The letter is pretty scathing, and I also called them out for something that I am fairly certain is illegal... I'm still debating on showing this to an attorney.

**End Result:** I'm never buying a Google phone again.  I'm getting used to a iPhone that was given to me, and I'm likely to stay iPhone at this point.  Once I receive the device, it's getting sold. Feel free to take a few pages out of my book to get the message across... Stand your ground if you know you're right... What a colossal waste of time.

 **What I would do if I had to do this shit all over again:** \#1: I wouldn't buy a Google phone at this point, and I still want to hear back from Investor Relations with an authentic answer. I hope one of their reps is reading this thread. #2: If you're out of warranty... I'd start off by doing what it says by ""asking your question to our Twitter account by tweeting '@MadeByGoogle' seen on the [1-year warranty info page](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/11833075?hl=en) \- they're better than any other basic customer support function and ""have a seemingly North American written response"" *if you know what I mean*... - I think either them or Investor Relations is what triggered the 'Customer Service Audit' where a Level 4 up specialist looked into my case, saw all the bullshit, and stepped in. In this thread, you'll hear people talking about their war stories and they mentioned resources like the BBB, the FTC, and maybe a few other channels. #3: I'd have your Date of Purchase, Date of Activation, Date of Issue, Original IEMI number (seen on the box), new IEMI number (if applicable), a picture/copy of your uBreakIFix receipts (keep ALL of them), and a link to the 1-year warranty page all handy at a moment's notice. You also need to explain to them that changing the motherboard changes the IEMI number, because they don't seem to get that... #4: Don't let them forward you to the ***Fi*** department (I bought from the *Fi store*)... The extended 1-year warranty is in the realm of the ***Pixel*** department. #5 - For you folks who have their phones completely bricked (no charging): The fix is the same as the black screen issue. It'll need a new motherboard. I think it'll be helpful for uBreakIFix to attempt a repair under the black screen warranty. Google can diagnose this as a ""power issue"" but my battery was never replaced and it magically started working again after the motherboard was replaced. Shocker, right? 

I hope this helps.

**EDIT #1:** The only thing I ""won"" was the battle. I'll be ""breaking even"" once I receive my phone. I ""lost"" my patience and a shitload of time, lol.

**EDIT #2:** The Radio is NOT under warranty; however, supposedly the radio is integrated into the motherboard (source: uBreakIFix) and when I'm getting a new motherboard, I'm getting a new radio along with it.  The Radio issue only came after the attempted black screen fix.

Hey guys!

So I have a Google Pixel 5 for review at XDA-Developers, and I wanted to reach out to the /r/GooglePixel community to see what questions you want answered. [I threw up some pictures on my Twitter if you want to check them out](https://twitter.com/AdamConwayIE/status/1314613190446252045), but I also wrote that hands-on article that's currently up on XDA too! 

Just a disclaimer: I can't *answer* any of your questions yet, but I'm currently in the course of writing my review and I'll try to cover as many of your questions as possible throughout it. So feel free to comment below, and anything I *can* answer currently I will answer!

Edit: Anything I don't answer at the moment I'm saving to cover in my full review! I'm just answering stuff I can for the moment - keep the questions coming :D Anything I can answer right now is basically anything that would be part of an ""unboxing"", so basically first five minutes impressions or so during setup and what's in the box, along with specs.

Edit2: Thank you for all the questions!! I'm currently scrolling through the thread and writing my review currently. Anything better suited to be answered individually once the review embargo lifts I'll come back and answer when I can! I'll still be keeping an eye on this thread as well for more ideas :)

GooglePixel,I’ve certainly tried.. but I can’t keep these thoughts to myself anymore..,"Little bit of a rant here and I’m sure I’ll get a flurry of downvotes but so be it. I received my Pixel 2XL today after anxiously waiting its arrival. I am switching from an iPhone 7 Plus. Just a little background I’ve had just about every flagship phone you can have within the past 6-7 years whether it’s Apple or Android. The reason being for this post is I just can’t comprehend or understand why everyone seems to be complaining and excuse my language but bitching about every little aspect of this phone possible. It got to the point where I had to go to Verizon multiple times after I preordered my phone because I was so worried about my purchase until I decided I’m so over hearing about everyone’s opinions I’d rather give it a test run myself and return it if I didn’t enjoy it.

GooglePixel,I've been testing Google Pixel 7 Pro — and it blows away the Galaxy S22 Ultra,
GooglePixel,Solved Pixel 3/3XL Performance Issues,"So, I have literally spent months trying different methods in attempts of fixing the Pixel 3 sluggishness and stuttering issues. I tried reboots, uninstalling unwanted apps, clearing the cache, full system wipes, etc but no matter what the performance issues would return.  A few days ago  I stared at my pixel 3 just confused why is performance so terrible, I personally don't believe it's the lack of ram but software related. I asked myself what is the last big feature that Google added to Android Pie?! Just maybe that is the culprit. Then, Digital Wellbeing came in to mind. So I went in to my settings clicked on Digital Wellbeing, clicked the 3 dots on the top right and turned off usage access. Disabling digital Wellbeing from tracking apps and data. After that, my phone has been butter smooth not one stutter or lag. Switching between apps is a breeze now, no more text input lag just speedy performance throughout the whole UI. Also, if you reduce animations in developer options it's a whole new experience (blazing fast). I highly recommend everyone who is experiencing performance issues (sluggishness, lag, stutters) throughout the UI to disable digital Wellbeing. Let us know if it fixed the performance issues and spread the word.

Best regards,

Update: It's been a week and with the workaround performance has been exceptional.

I've had the same number for 20+ years.

GooglePixel,"As a pixel user, I'm now afraid to buy new pixels in the future.","After messing around a little bit in the subreddit, especially in the past two months, I've seen A LOT of people complaining about having hardware issues, covered by warranty and never getting their phone back for ""free"", because of google ""scamming"" them and saying that they found more problems. Another thing that makes me worry a lot are all of the complaints about the support just being inexistent for some issues, but one of the most annoying thing is that I pay full price for half the feature (I'm italian and like many other European countries I didn't get the new assistant, car crash detecion, recorder transcript and stuff like that). I want my pixel 4 to last at least another 2-3 years, but then I don't really know if I should go with another pixel or not... I like everything about this phone, from the hardware to the software, but the ""shady"" things google is doing right now really make me think about stepping back from buying another pixel phone. I was wondering if maybe europe rules make the customer support act different? Please let me know what you think about that."
GooglePixel,I would like the option to send a fax machine noise when screening spam callers.,"So instead of 'Tell me more' or 'Remove me from this list', I would like the option to send a fax machine noise.

GooglePixel,"""Driving Detected"" - I'm about to throw my Pixel 5 out of my truck window...","I use my phone on a vent mount/holder in my F150, connected via Bluetooth. I used to use the Android Auto app on my phone but Google killed that and now we have driving mode.

A couple months ago I turned on the setting to detect driving and ask if I want to enter driving mode, since the only other way is to use Google Assistant with no option for a shortcut. Since I enabled that, it began randomly popping up when I picked my phone up off my desk or take it out of my pocket, yet I can drive 100 km/h on the highway to work and it won't detect my driving until I'm pulling into my parking spot at the office, so I turned it off.

I have now turned that setting off 10 times, ~~it lasts for a day or two and then randomly turns back on~~ but if you back out of the settings page and go back in, it turns itself back on immediately."
GooglePixel,The Pixel 6 will have an in display fingerprint reader.,"The great Google biometric dilemma. I've heard glowing and not so glowing opinions of the fingerprint sensor on the back, power button is optimal position imo. My personal view is that in display fingerprint readers have inferior speed and are also a little awkward. 

I'm a firm believer in having some kind of intentional interaction before the phone unlocking, and all the implementations of in display readers I have seen unlock the phone immediately, accidental unlocks may be an issue. I've never used one however, do you folk think it's a good move?

I'm a Pixel 4 user and a sucker for motion sense, I know, crazy. I love the quick face unlock but maybe it's just what I'm used to."
GooglePixel,"Had to Call 911, It actually worked.","So I'm a dasher. And stupid stuff is pretty common when dashing. This is the first time I've had to call 911 tho. Before this, the last few times I'd tried it failed and wouldn't let me call out. The experience was cool actually. Once I dialed 911, the phone when it Emergency Mode, gave me my location, cross streets, allowed me to send information not over the voice if I wanted and notify my emergency contacts I have set up all in seconds. 

I know we've had issues on pixels in the past, I know I have. Just figured I'd post letting people know it worked at least once."
GooglePixel,"""Historical"" (10+ years) iOS user switching to Android (Pixel 4) - My experience","I hate the customised versions of Android most companies offer (Samsung, LG, One+, Motorola) and I was skeptical even with the real vanilla Android offered by Google. Being a UI/X designer myself, the visual part of the OS is extremely important to me. I particularly hated the fact that even pure Android had different shaped icons (unlike iOS, and unlike they do now...thankfully!), which in my opinion caused chaos and it was truly hideous in general. In general, the whole OS aesthetic looked incoherent and poorly polished, to me, compared to Apple's iOS. Luckily, Material Design arrived and Google started taking UI/X design seriously. i gave it 3-4 years to mature and last month i finally felt ready for the switch. Let me just specify the reason of my switch is how boring iOS is. A static OS, slow to evolve and add new, meaningful features. So yeah, I went on  and bough a Pixel 4. Holy cow...I'm freaking loving. The minimalism, coherence, playfulness, iconography, attention to details and visual design in general within the OS are great. Not to mention the huge variety of stock wallpapers offered by google...truly mind blowing. I have absolutely no doubt at all the Google Pixel will be my daily drivers for many years to come. Only downside...and it hurts to say that, apps are kinda better on iOS. Especially Instagram. I have no idea as to why, but i can definitely live with it. Google Pixel 4, love you buddy!

GooglePixel,Pixel and Pixel XL Customization Starter Guide,"I've done a few of these for other device subreddits and so far [each of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/426ivu/nexus_6p_customization_starter_guide/) has been [well received](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/4v1am7/oneplus_3_customization_starter_guide/). I know the Pixel/Nexus community generally has a handle on how to customize their own device, but I'm hoping this is useful for the beginners.

___________
**[Pixel & Pixel XL Customization Starter Guide](https://www.androidexplained.com/pixel-starter-guide/)**
______________

I write these tutorials in a way that (hopefully) anyone can understand. They're broken down into very basic, step by step instructions as I walk you through how to complete them from start to finish.

I've even started to record videos and I've been embedding them into each tutorial page for those who learn better by watching rather than reading.

Still, there are dozens of tutorials and it can be daunting for anyone who has just started learning how to customize Android devices. This is why I put together this starter guide(which was actually a request from the LG G3 subreddit that I was writing device tutorials for).

________________

This starter guide is a way for me to group up all the tips and tutorials that I have specifically written for the Pixel phones into 4 categories. The first is a basic category and these don't need to be done in a certain order. These are just things that are good to know about (and I also reference them in other tutorial articles).

The next two are for rooting the Pixel phones, and they need to be done in a certain order (which is why they're numbered). There are two here with the first also walking you through fully installing TWRP and the other method keeps TWRP read only so it is easier to accept OTA updates.

The last category contains software tips and tricks that are software based and already built into Android 7.x . I've come to understand that not everyone wants to dig through the settings menu to find hidden features so I write about them and so them off on video.

This way you can check out some of the features of the Pixel phones without needing to hunt for them and enable them for yourself.

GooglePixel,Re-register your fingers after Jan update,"P6 got Jan update a few days ago. While I didn't have ""bad experience"" like MKBHD did, fingerprint sensor was at best, passable. After the update, I didn't see any improvement. 

Then today, reading an article from Chromeunboxed, Robbie mentioned that he re-registered the fingerprints. So, I did. Wow, it's a big improvement. Not sure if this works win any ""fastest fp reader"" award but it's almost on par with my P3 physical sensor.

So, if you have not seen improvement, it's no harm re-registering.

Edit: u/k00lguys suggested not to remove all existing fingerprints or we'll have to re-enable apps that authenticate using fingerprints. I learned it the hard way."
GooglePixel,Jon Prosser: Pixel 4a (Black) delayed yet again to October 22; “Barely Blue” has been removed entirely.,
GooglePixel,Google did the right thing.,"In light of all the recent reports of the rear camera glass shattering without any physical damage, I was extremely nervous about contacting Google when it happened to one of the Pixel 7 Pro's I purchased. 

From what I gathered, getting a phone replacement without having to pay for repairs wasn't too common. Needless to say, my anxiety about the possibility of having to pay for something when not being at fault was very high. Here's how my experience went.

When I contacted customer service online regarding the issue, I requested a call back. Upon speaking to the rep, I made it very clear immediately that the camera glass breaking was not the result from a drop or physical impact of any kind. I was as polite as possible about it.

After speaking with the first customer service rep, I was told this would be covered under warranty, and they transferred me to a device support rep.  The device support rep asked me for the phone's IMEI number, (a serial number works as well) and a picture of the phone without a case on it. I provided both, and they escalated it and gave me a call back after about 20 minutes. 

They gave me two options: I could send in the damaged phone after being factory reset, and they would send me a new one, or I could request a new one with a temporary hold on a credit card with that hold being removed once they got the old phone.

I was very pleased with this outcome, and it tells me Google is very aware of this issue, and at least from my experience, they made it right without hesitation. I didn't have to argue about how the damage occurred, nor was I ever questioned about it. I have preferred care for both phones, and that was never brought up once while talking to either of the reps. With that being said, if this has happened to you, here is my advice:

When contacting Google about it, ask for a call back so you can speak to a person. Let them know right away that this didn't happen from a physical impact or drop.  Be very polite and courteous, as this can go a long way towards a positive resolution. 

I hope this helps."

GooglePixel,Android 12 is already wearing on me,"The big ugly stupid fucking clock on the lock screen, the bizarre background stuff that has turned all my notifications pink even though I have a different background set, the obnoxious pull down that takes up the whole screen and adds button pushes to do stuff.

I want 11 back. I feel like 12 has really stepped away from technical and business users and taken a big leap toward iPhone users. It's so disappointing. For the first time in a long time I really am unhappy with the ""next version"" of android."
GooglePixel,I wouldn't believe anything about 'Pixel 5' out there quite yet.,
GooglePixel,"Support promised me an email response within 48 hours, then ignored me for 9 days, then had the fucking balls to send me a ""we hope we were able to fix your problem to your satisfaction"" email survey.","What the fuck is wrong with these people?? My camera hasn't worked for weeks, the same issue that's plaguing hundreds of Pixel 2 owners. Tech support went through the typical bullshit (clear cache, safe mode, factory reset) and when none of that worked, had me generate a bug report. I responded to the email with that bug report, and didn't hear from them for over a week. Now it seems they have closed my case without fixing it or responding in any meaningful way.

I'm so fucking sick of being jerked around by these assholes. They don't know how to fix anything and they just ignore you if their hardware or software is causing you any real problem. All they know how to do is recommend safe mode and a factory reset, or send you an outdated set of troubleshooting tips from a previous version of Android.

I've never been treated this badly in my life by a company I've given so much money to (well, besides my health insurance provider). This is fucking insane.

edit: Didn't expect this to get so much attention. My anger and profanity was immature and probably doesn't help the situation at all. My apologies if anyone feels personally attacked. I *love* the Pixel brand as a product and a community, but the support has been appalling."

GooglePixel,How I traded up to a Pixel 3 for free. Actually got some money back!,"So first off, you should know if you buy major electronics with your AMEX or CITI card, they will extend the manufacturer warranty by a year (two for Citi).

I bought my OG Pixel XL new around Feb 2017.  So the manufacturer warranty expired March 2018.  Amex warranty then started.  A few months back, my Quick Charge stopped working, and I noticed my Android Auto would disconnect often.  So I started the Amex Warranty process.  It's very simple!  They had me fill out a few forms, then take the phone to an authorized repair facility (ubreakifix).  They looked at the phone, said Google doesn't provide replacement mother boards for the USB C port, and they couldn't repair it.  Got that printed on a sheet and submitted to AMEX.  About a week and a half later, a credit showed up on my AMEX account for the original purchase price of $894! 

While this process was ongoing, I went ahead and ordered a Pixel 3 and selected the trade in option.  Amex didn't require me to send my OG Pixel anywhere!  So I paid for the new P3 with my AMEX.  My P3 came in about a week after my AMEX credit hit my account.  Perfect!

Just this past week, I received  emails stating my $50 credit from the P3 purchase promotion was in my account.  I also got an email stating Google received my OG P XL and would be crediting my AMEX $150.  

So there was an initial entry cost, but I basically was able to trade up for free, and receive $200 in credit.  I'll probably hold on to this phone for another few years and see if I can keep this train going.

Edit:  I also want to say I was surprised that I got the full $154 for my OG XL.  There was a very hard to see hairline fracture on the front, many scuffs and dings on the sides, and the back glass by the camera was smashed to shit, even whole flakes missing.  I sent it in, in my former wallet case.  Checked the ""Screen turns on and no cracks"" checkbox.  Got the ""full value""..."

Update: After seeing some comments here, it had to do with the back of my hand hitting the crown a few times in a row whilst plunging, that made the call."
GooglePixel,first Pixel update for the year!,
GooglePixel,"8 years of Nexus/Pixel devices and I went to s10+ three days ago, HATE IT","So obviously there was an adjustment going from stock Android to the Samsung UI.  I set up Nova Launcher to get the phone set up the way I like it.

Bloatware on the Samsung is annoying.

But the biggest complaint is that the phone screen doesn't wake up when it receives a notification.  I had to install a third party app to do that?

Gonna see if I can take it back to the shop and just stick with my 2 XL

Then I was told we'd talk about warranty options, and we did. A bit of waiting while my operator gathered some details quickly. I told him my address and whatever he needed. That was it. 16 minutes in total!

GooglePixel,Me about everything 30 to 40 mins,
GooglePixel,I switched to the iPhone 12... and I switched back,"As you might find out in my post history I made a post asking if the Pixel 2XL to 5 is a sidegrade instead of an upgrade. I was contemplating switching to the iPhone 12 pro, and I eventually did.  I decided to make the switch as I no longer thought of myself as a power user (no rooting, minor sideloading, no customization). For a little bit more context, I own an iPad pro (2017) and I've been using macOS as well as windows devices for the last 10-12 years (both have their strengths but that's a different topic). I've never owned an iPhone before.

Is the iPhone 12 pro a good phone? Yes, it most certainly is. The hardware is great. The SOC just eats through everything you throw at it. The taptic engine is something google should introduce on the Pixel as it sparks little moments of joy. If you select a date with the scroll wheels it just feels like you're swiping through a real scroll wheel with little clicks. The glass sandwich with stainless steel sides feel like a premium device.

The software side of things is a breeze if it works.

**My experience**

Apple has changed, the Apple of Steve Jobs is dead. I think the reason why our tech got so good was because company's had to keep up with the great UX of the iPhones and iPads and the wonderful ecosystem Apple had created. Back in the days I used to look at iPhones of my friends with wonder while my own android based HTC was a hot mess of crashes and very bad software updates. The iPhone just worked, had high quality apps (I will never forget the pre material design apps on Android) and the camera was great.

Maybe my expectation were too high or maybe I just expected much from a €1159 euro phone but the experience was a let down. If the software works it works, if it doesn't work it's a search for loopholes as iOS doesn't want you to control anything. I knew the lack of control iOS gave the user from my long use of iPads but that is 'just' a tablet, not my main device.

*iCloud*

The syncing with iCloud is good, if it works. If it doesn't work it just doesn't work at all. My iCloud storage was full (partly my bad, partly why should my iPad backup huge PDF's without asking me?) but when I removed something from my iCloud storage my iPhone wouldn't detect that I removed the files. Eventually I had to reboot my phone to get it to see there was free storage. I wanted to make a backup of my photos and videos on iCloud. There is no way to force this unless you toggle the iCloud switch in settings. When I did I got the message my phone only keeps high quality pictures on my device and original in the cloud. I never said I wanted that but ok, Apple thinks this is the way. I couldn't turn off my iCloud until the original quality pictures were back on my phone (wait, I tried to turn it off to get it to sync to my iCloud as my pictures weren't in iCloud?). I decided to leave it be, they would auto upload to my iCloud when I put my phone on the charger and decided I no longer had interest in looking at the pictures and videos on a decent size screen.

*Pictures*

The pictures are good but they are oversaturated. My Pixel will capture the astounding browns of fall and was willing to let winter be winter with a grim grey sky and mute colors just as I perceived the scene. The iPhone just gave me a blue sky and oversaturated greens and blues, the pictures felt like spring instead of winter. If you're willing to edit pictures this is a great phone for you. I want a phone that captures the scene I'm enjoying. If I wanted to get pictures I needed to edit afterwards I would grab my mirrorless camera. Because of the bigger sensor the night mode is better on the iPhone 12 pro but the lens flare ruins the shots.

*Video*

Video is leaps and bounds ahead of my pixel 2XL. The Dolby Vision looks great (if you have the device that supports playback) and the stabilisation is really good for handheld usage. I think the 10-bit video is great but not that useful you're not into videography. The thing I really dislike is the lens flare when shooting in dawn and in the night. It ruins the footage and it's unacceptable for a phone of this price. Apple needs to fix this.

*The notifications*

Not too much to say about this, both the iOS and Android way work but it's different. Get used to it and both are good.

*The experience/OS's*

People that are saying that the UX of Apple is better haven't used Android in a good long while. Android has come a long way. The much touted animations of iOS are just as good on the Android side. The way the gestures work on iOS, Android has caught up with them. The only thing I need to give to iOS are the haptics, they are truly great but when I switched back I never missed them. Both OS's are mature and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Both OS's are great for set up and forget usage.

*The ecosystem*

This is not as good as expected, had some trouble connecting to my Apple TV and when the connecting doesn't work the error message aren't helpful (no error messages at all). Furthermore the ecosystem is crazy expensive. I was a click away from buying the Apple watch but when I was at the gate of the walled garden and looked back I saw a plethora of good enough android smartwatches at half the price. Everybody should decide this for their own but I just couldn't get myself to committing to an overpriced ecosystem when there's a lot of fun, cheaper third party android stuff around.

*The price*

I absolutely don't want to be the guy calling Apple phones, tablets and macs expensive (accessories are overpriced, I'll be the first one to agree) as I don't think they are. If you use most of them as long as you get support from them they are a great bang for buck. I use my iPads as long as they get support. The older macintoshes were a great bang for buck (the newer MacBook Pro's are not that great), the initial investment was a lot higher but they were great until the end.

*The hardware*

Definitely a win for iPhone. It's just feels premium in your hands. My biggest problem with the hardware is that the premium feel is masked by the cover you choose. The Glass sandwich feels very vulnerable mix in the high price and I couldn't use this without cover. Maybe you can but to each their own. I really enjoyed the hardware mute switch, it's wonderful. The click of when you switch it just feels great and you can do it without looking. I know Oneplus has this as well and I enjoyed the feature on my Oneplus One. This is something I would love to see on the Pixel lineup.

*'power users'*

I said I no longer think of myself as a power user and I'm not. The lack of control in iOS just made me long to get back to Android. I found myself to be the type of user who wants to do things his own way. I don't want Apple taking me by the hand and decide for me their way is the only way. They're opening this up but it's opening up very slowly. iOS is great if you expect a phone to tell you how to use it, in return you'll get a safe environment where it's difficult to do anything 'wrong'. If you're the type of user that wants control over how you use the phone Android is the way to go.

**My conclusion**

The iPhone isn't worth the cost of entry to me. It's a good phone but it's not that much better than my Pixel 2XL for day to day use. If I buy a €1159 phone I expect it to be flawless and it just isn't. I'm not a someone that uses a phone 5 years. I've used my Pixel 2XL for 3 years and it's the first phone where I would love to use it another year just to see what te Pixel 6 brings. My battery is acceptable and with my covid lockdown lifestyle it's sufficient. I've put in my order for the Pixel 5 a few days ago and I'm happy to be back in team Pixel.

If you're trying to decide to go for <insert iPhone model here> I think the most important conclusion is in the 'power user' paragraph.*""iOS is great if you expect a phone to tell you how to use it, in return you'll get a safe environment where it's difficult to do anything 'wrong'. If you're the type of user that wants control over how you use the phone Android is the way to go.""*

You'll get used to the rest of the stuff (the good and the bad) but this will sting you every day you use iOS. I want to add to this that you should also go for Android if you're an early adopter or just want the latest tech stuff.

**Proof I have the phone**
https://imgur.com/a/XrSz0iA

**Device Info HW Screenshots**
https://imgur.com/Rk29cdo

**Size** Smaller than Pixel 7, but slightly wide and taller than Pixel 6a. The 6a would still be the best one handed phone below $500 IMHO. Above $500 it would be Galaxy S23 (never had the Zenfone 9 to compare).

**Design** Same as Pixel 7, they did make the display flush with the frame like on Pixel 7. If you thought Pixel 7 had sharp edges then Pixel 7a also has them. ~~Plastic frame~~ Metal frame since 6a has metal frame, and plastic back since its not cold to touch on the frame like Pixel 7. Volume rockers and power button have moved down a bit when compared to Pixel 6a. 

**Hardware** Tensor g2, 8gb ldppr5 samsung ram, goodix finderprint, face unlock on deck, samsung display, stereo speakers. 

**Weight**
6.8oz or 193g
the pixel 7 comes out to 197g on the same scale
the pixel 6a with a screen protector comes to 187g

**Display** Same size as Pixel 6a, 90hz confirmed. UI is smooth as Pixel mostly are unless you switching from a 144hz phone and scroll through twitter like crazy in which case you will find it laggy. Colors are good, not S23 quality but good. Bezels are bigger as compared to Pixel 6a. Maybe because of frame wrap around display design.On Pixel 6a, display sits a bit above the frame. Not good for direct sunlight just like Pixel 7 & Pixel 6a. Pixel 6a screen protector will work on Pixel 7a, will be close but will line up.

**Battery** 4300mah per device info hw app. 18-20w wired charging per the usb metered cable I have. Wireless charging confirmed. No reverse wireless. 

**Biometrics**
Under display fingerprint scanner (NOT ultrasonic) is as fast or slow as Pixel 7. Does not unlock with unrecognized fingerprint (like it did on Pixel 6a at launch). Face Unlock on deck. 

**Sound & Haptics**
Stereo speakers are decent, and haptics are same as Pixel 6a. Not Pixel 7 or Galaxy S23 class.

**Software**
Running March 2023 security, and October 2022 Play System. No updates available, might be released on launch day. I dont see spatial audio option, but clear calling is present. 

**Camera** 

Gcam version is 8.8.225.

What can I say, its a Pixel. Pictures are Pixel quality. Main and wide angle pictures are both 16.1mp. Main is f/1.9 and wide angle is f/2.2. front is f/2.2, 12.2mp pictures. 

Front camera can do 4k, no option to switch between 30 and 60fps, so am assuming its 4k30 only. 

I dont see Action mode or cinematic mode as a camera option. Do see long exposure.

Finally, Google closed my case and here is the final answer.

Should I sue Google? FedEx? Both? I don't want to file a dispute with the credit card company because I know I will be blacklisted by them or by Google. I think police won't help much, specially because I think this package was never delivered. I don't know what to do. Any help?

# UPDATE 1:

I found a [very similar topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9sjz2s/fedex_lost_shipment_google_wont_send_me_a/) where Google reversed their decision thanks to Reddit. So guys please help me making Google see this post!

# UPDATE 2:

* A Pixel Community Manager from Google /u/PixelCommunity messaged me saying that they're investigating.
* I also submitted a Reddit request to /u/dmziggy. He emailed me back saying that they're looking into the issue.
* Then I received another response from my original request with google support and the same person that told me to contact the police for help told me they will check with ""other department"".

I don't understand what's so difficult. FedEx already admitted their fault but they said that only the shipper can initiate a claim because their contract is with google not me.

# UPDATE 3:

This is the proof of delivery I got from FedEx:  [https://prnt.sc/ptjn7j](https://prnt.sc/ptjn7j)  this would be funny, if it were not so sad.

# UPDATE 4:

As per Nov 10th, no one from Google Support has contacted me again. I've asked /u/PixelCommunity for updates in my case, no response.

# UPDATE 5 (REFUND ISSUED):

So today after more than 3 weeks or trouble they finally issued a refund for me.

**My advice is: If you have to buy from google store, use a throw away google account so you won't care if they suspend it in case you have to file a charge back. If anything goes wrong with you order, Google won't help you.**

Thank you very much for everyone who supported me."
GooglePixel,Google acknowledges Pixel 6 network bug following December update,
GooglePixel,Google pixel voice recording with transcribe is now available,
GooglePixel,Why this channel is full of complaints?? Any happy pixel users?,"Everyday in this channel, I see tons and tons of complaints, how their pixel is acting weird, bootlooped or stopped working. Is it only me  whose pixel has been working flawlessly(bought it in january). Yea, I had couple of small issues, but that's normal, since my ipad on ios 13 is also not without issues. The only problem that I have is that spotify shuts down automatically three or four times a day in android 10. Other than that, it is smooth and works pretty good. 

I am also subscribed to iphone and Apple channels on reddit, and the complains are nowhere near this channel. I wonder why is that, is it because Pixels are full of issues or pixel users are generally more loud in comparison to iphone users. 

So, is it me or anyone else have their pixel 3, 2  or OG working perfectly?
Update: From replies, I think phones work great, until you have to go to Google support where it's a mix bag."
GooglePixel,"You've got to give Google's ""Now Playing"" feature credit for trying","I have a printer on my desk at work, and I was printing several pages while my Pixel 2 sat about a foot away. As it was printing, I noticed that a song had popped up on the Now Playing section. There was no music playing, so I was curious.

The song was Sofi Needs a Ladder by deadmau5. Here's a youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDndZn0YPdI

My guess is the Now Playing feature mistook the first ten seconds of a techno song with ten seconds of technology. I can't tell if this is a subtle critique of the genre or if this is simply working as intended."

Now I finally got around to so it and wanted to share in case some people have a 1st gen lying around and are looking for a use for it. It's actually not very difficult.

Flashed Pixeldust Rom, because it comes with a small Gapps package included and so that it will stay updated.
To sync the photos from my P5 I use [SyncThing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid). It's open source, highly customizable and works reliably. I set it up to sync the DCIM/camera folder (send only on P5, receive only on OG Pixel).  
I then disabled photo backup on the P5.

GooglePixel,A Hidden Gem: the Pixel Recorder,"Recorder apps tend to be fairly bare bones. They record audio and allow you to play them back, offline. But Google's exclusive recorder app for Pixel is fantastic and so much more functional. 

1. It backs up all your recordings to your Google account, if you wish, accessible on recorder.google.com.

2. Nearly instant and very accurate text transcription, which you can then copy, modify, make a Google doc, and print. Search and find whatever you're looking for! 

3. You can change the playback speed of the recording! Very useful for long meetings and lectures! 

4. Automated labels!  

5. Download the .WAV audio or the .TXT text file, right from the app or from the browser. 

If you're a student, if you're involved in interviews, or if you just like voice recordings, check it out! It's fantastic and has made my life so much easier.


EDIT: thank you for all your comments and stories! I didn't expect this to take off like it did, and I'm so glad that there's so much love for the recorder app."

GooglePixel,Pixel 7 Pro said to have 1500 Nits of Brightness,
GooglePixel,The auto brightness of this phone is driving me up the fucking wall,"I have had the Pixel 6 since 2 weeks after launch, so it's had plenty of time to learn my brightness habits. It's had plenty of time to adjust to my usual conditions. Even still, I have never had this much difficulty with having to correct the auto-brightness in a phone than the struggle I endure with the Pixel. 

I can be sitting in a stationary position, in an unchanging environment, light or dim and the auto brightness just can't figure out what to do. Without even moving the phone, the brightness will just drop. Or increase. And cause me to have to adjust it. It was fine a couple times but when I have to do it regularly, something is up. 

Never have I had to fight with an otherwise silly feature on a phone and something tells me if it hasn't figured out lighting conditions after this long, it probably never will.

/rant

Edit: I fixed it. Turned the damn thing off."
GooglePixel,Finally got my pixel 6 pro fingerprint sensor to be consistently faster,"I've put way too much time into finding a workaround for this problem that shouldn't have existed in the first place.  Below is the method that got the best result so far (less than one second unlocks 95% of the time).  This will not work for someone who needs to enroll more than two fingers.  

First, you enroll your primary finger in the exact position that you usually hold your phone, but apply the absolute lightest pressure you can to the screen that it will read. I'm talking feather light while following the very specific instructions on the screen.

Next, in the same position with the same finger perform another enrollment but this time with firm pressure.

Optionally,  you can use another finger to enroll the same way but you want to save at least 1 of the 5 allowed enrollments for later.

Now you wait until you're in a different place and experience a very bad read on your finger. That is where you stop (if safe) and use one of the remaining enrollments to enroll that specific scenario. This isn't perfect, but I found that I needed a version of my primary finger that was enrolled while in daylight, outside with the sun overhead.  You may need a copy when your finger is dry, cold, or all the above.  If you didn't enroll a second finger, you can use the remaining enrollments to help the phone learn more situations.

We shouldn't have to lick our fingers or type our password on this 2021 flagship phone.  I hope Google figures out a way to make this better, or enroll more copies of our prints, but for now this is the most reliable method for me."

I was so close to going back to Samsung so props to Google for finally getting their shit together 😌"
GooglePixel,My phone survived for a week burried in a foot of after a blizzard!,"Last Tuesday, there was a very heavy snow fall where I live, and so naturally to try and bring myself some joy and break up the monotony of home working I went for a frolick. The snow was really heavy and it was getting in my coat pockets, so I put my phone in my back jeans pocket under my long coat. 

My flatmate was taking videos of me skipping in the snow. About 2 minutes later I realised my phone was no longer in my back pocket. We retraced our steps, the snow was still fresh so we could see exactly where we walked and we carefully looked for the phone. We couldn't understand why it wasn't immediately jumping out at us. There was however a terribly suspicious man standing where we had been and we immediately jumped to conclusions, particularly because he was being ""overly helpful"". I had tried using ""find my phone"" but couldn't pinpoint close enough and the 5 minute ringing facility didn't seem to be working. After about 30 minutes of searching in the snow, I went home contacted my provider and blocked the phone and ordered a replacement SIM card. I decided to report it lost/stolen at the nearest police station, at which point I gave a description of the suspicious man. 

The next day, I was viewing the videos my flatmate took of me and just happened to zoom in. I managed to pin point the exact moment the phone fell out of my pocket. As convinced as I was it had been stolen, I have returned to the park every day for the last week to dig and find the phone. The snow had started melting yesterday, although still some ice, but I still hadn't found the phone so resigned myself to the fact that my initial suspicion was correct. 

This morning after heavy rain, and the snow completely gone, my partner secretly snuck out to the park. There, completely unscathed and still working, my Google Pixel 3XL. 

I still cannot believe it. 

Tomorrow, I need to return to the police station, tail between my legs and tell them how stupid I was and that man WAS really being helpful. 

At least my faith in humanity and technology has been somewhat restored during such a shitty time."
GooglePixel,4a wallpaper ported to all phones!,
GooglePixel,So it turns out borrowing a friends Sim Card Tray will void your warranty.,"So I'm a little bit annoyed.

My Sim Tray cracked at one end and eventually broke leaving my sim card stuck inside my phone. Using a pin I was able to remove the sim card and friend who had a spare Pixel 2 leant me his sim tray as I needed my phone urgently for work.

Contacted Google for an RMA as my phone still has a year left under warranty. I foolishly mentioned I'd been using my friends Sim Tray in the interim and they asked me to confirm this was the case. I said yes assuming this was part of the problem solving path, but they then informed me that in doing so I'd breached the terms of my warranty and am no longer covered for manufacturing defects which otherwise would have fixed my phone. I can buy a spare sim tray online no problem, but if anything else goes wrong with my phone in the next year..I'm toast.

I'm pretty annoyed, at myself for even mentioning my friends sim tray and also at them for being so stubborn. I paid around AU$1200 for the phone and instantly voided it's warranty by using an OEM part borrowed from a friend. 

They've always been fantastic in the past, but this may cause me to reconsider my relationship with google going ahead in the future."
GooglePixel,I put together simple AMOLED wallpapers that line the edges of the Pixel 2 XL,"[Here's a preview.](https://i.imgur.com/06Jin03.png)

I was inspired by wallpapers I've seen for the both the iPhone X and Galaxy Note 8. Thought they were pretty cool so I decided to go ahead and make a few for the Pixel 2 XL. I made one with Google colors and others using only one color.

Note: These wallpapers look best when your display calibration is set to saturated. Really makes the edges pop! Also, these were made to be used in immersive mode!

EDIT 1: I realize that for some, the border may be a bit too thick. I'll remedy that and release a slimmer version soon! Sit tight.

EDIT 2: Due to many requests, slim versions are now [live](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ED69NMoW0j6EE5eHuYLgglTdf_OAaOwz?usp=sharing)! The rounded edges are now much cleaner.

I have also been getting many requests as to how I got my home screen the way it is. Since a lot of people seem to be interested, I will be posting instructions on how to get it this way here.

**Launcher:** Nova Prime (If you don't have prime, [buy it now](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&hl=en)! It's on sale for 99c. Totally worth it!)

**Icons:** [Min - Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanmkelly.me.min&hl=en)

**Widgets:** [KWGT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.widget&hl=en) in conjunction with [Huk KWGT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hukkwgt.kustom.pack&hl=en).

1. After installing all the prerequisites, launch Nova Launcher and go into its settings. To do this long tap at an empty spot on your home screen and on the bottom left there should be settings.

***If you are already aware of how to load preset settings into Nova you can just restore my backup file by downloading it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SR5bIDbFYfO3jEfgSEdt4k98ze0pQMxM/view?usp=sharing).***

2. Tap look and feel > Icon theme and select ""Min""

3. (Optional) Disable the dock: Nova Settings > Dock > Enable (Off)

4. Set your home screen to allow more icons. Nova Settings > Desktop > Desktop Grid > Set it to 7 on the left and 6 on the bottom.

5. Next, you want to scale the icons up so they don't appear small. To do this go to Desktop > Icon Layout > Icon Size = 150%. Right under that, you can disable labels too if you want (which is what I did).

6. Next, you want to set up the widgets. To do this long tap on the home screen and add a KWGT widget. Choose 4x2 and resize it to match the size of my ""December"" widget. Once it's on the desktop, tap on it and choose the widget that I used. You'll need to find it amongst all the other widgets available. Once selected, there should be a ""layer"" tab that you can tap. Tap it. Set the scale to 220 (Or whatever size you prefer). Once that is done, tap the save icon on the top right and press home. The widget should appear on your desktop at the proper scale.

7. For my center widget and bottom, the process is the same as above. Find it and edit it's ""layer"" tab once more. This time I set the scale to 105. To change the avatar icon to a photo of your choice, go to the ""items"" tab. Profile Pic & Time > Profile pic > Load a photo of your choice. Once that is finished, once again hit save on the top right and go home.

8. Enjoy your newly themed home screen!

EDIT 5: You know what? It's 2 am right now but maybe there are other things that need to be done! Finally, the highly requested wallpapers for the OG Pixel XL! **Click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15R3ufr6269sygJbJbqjvZowF1xjJn-Wo?usp=sharing) to download them!** I figured since a lot of you have been waiting for them, I might as well have created them before going off to bed. With this, I hope I have satisfied all you Pixel users out there!

**Also, the wallpapers made for the Pixel 2 will work wonderfully with the OG Pixel.** This was pointed out to me by /u/filmgeekvt. Thanks for the heads up!

I will now be going to bed so I'll answer any messages or concerns in the morning. Still though, can't believe how this progressed! From a simple wallpaper idea into having to adapt it to multiple sizes and resolutions because of demand. And getting reddit gold too! (Thank you, kind stranger!!) Never expected that! Thank you guys for the kinds words and for your general interest in this! You're all awesome."
GooglePixel,Is Google ever going to add new wallpapers to the Pixel. Live Earth wallpapers are amazing but they are the same ones since I got the phone in November,
GooglePixel,Switching to Pixel was the best decision I've made.,"Hey,

I've come from a Note8 and before that I was an Apple user since iPhone 1. So, here it is...

**The Phone:**

I've never felt a phone *feel* as good as the Pixel in my hands. I'm an average sized man with dainty computer hands, as my wife puts it, and the phone fits. Its edges all merry to one another and the transitions are seamless. This makes the everyday pickup, use, hold, put away, fumble, twirl of my phone like no other. The construction of it feels really solid but it doesn't feel like some hard piece of hardware in my pocket. The overall size of the Pixel 3 is perfect for typing on one hand if needed and even reaching across the full screen when I'm one handing it in my offhand. 

Coming from the Note 8 I was a little worried about the screen but it's honestly the best screen I've looked at. Its gorgeous. Its bright. its colors aren't over saturated or over processed. It seems to reproduce visuals with sensitivity to the content you're viewing. The Note 8 over processed its colors and I had to go in and change many things to get it to feel right. Or just neutral and balanced. 

The buttons click with satisfaction. The fingerprint sensor is perfectly placed. its such a natural position. When I grab my phone I don't even realize that my finger is already right next to or over the sensor. Its so perfect. 

The speakers... I'm actually astonished at how well they reproduce clear sound without distortion that you normally hear from that annoying person on your commute home. They aren't overly bright and tinny, they feel right for their size. We're not talking crazy bass or anything like that but you won't be annoyed by them by any means when you're using your phone to listen to some tunes while you clean a room. They're fairly loud and that is also pretty cool. 

**The accessories:** 

I actually really enjoy the pixel buds. I know... call me crazy but the ability to adjust the size of the little hoops that keep the headphones in my ears is fantastic. They also sound really great. I mean, I have DT 770 pros and I do live audio mixing and so on and for headphones that you get as an accessory to your phone, they really have fantastic sound. They don't try to color your sound or change it to fake anything. They stay true to, as close to true, as the recording that you're listening to. They also don't' hurt the ear after extended use. I kind of forget they're in my ears. This is particularly nice on commutes and just cruising around. No, they are not going to noise cancel. They let in your atmosphere and I'm ok with this. I want to hear the world around me a bit so I can be aware of my surrounding. Bonus: they plug in via USB-C and integrate with Assistant. You can program your voice for assistant with the headphones specifically. Thats great! I wish more headphones did this. 

The rapid charger is crazy fast. The dongle for standard 1/8 headphone jack is a nice to have and the USB-USB-C adapter is always appreciated so I can plugin whatever I want into my pixel. 

**The OS:**

I thought iOS was good. Even superior to Android but I was so limited on how I wanted my phone to function. I switched and I felt free. So so free of the walls that Apple had built around me. Absolutely freeing. I don't even know how to explain it but I just felt happy. 

Android on a Note 8 is a bit bloated. So I had to do all I could to configure the device, which was great that I could, to make it more like stock Android with some awesome custom skins and all that but some of the Samsung stuff just kept popping up. I wish I could just remove it all but manufacturers are just not going to let you do that. Bummer. 

Stock Android is so crisp and clean. It's warm and homey. its the invitation I think all Apple users need to finally see how amazing this OS is. I love how everything is at your fingertips. I can move stuff around and make it mine. The Notifications are easily the best thing on Android, IMO. I can read, reply and see everything clearly. I know just by the icon what app is trying to get my attention. I love this. The way that the AOD utilizes simple icons to give you a glanceable overview of life is a thing of beauty. The simple readout of a notification or calendar invite is so easily digested that it doesn't derail you from whatever you were doing. 

The OS is made for you. Its made for you to feel like you're not trying to use an OS. It's not designed with the intent of making you do things a specific way and only that way. I love that. It's a relief to know I own what this software is going to feel like for me.

**Project Fi:**

I jumped boats and I couldn't be happier. The thought that my bill will never exceed X, no matter where I roam or how I use it is fantastic. The fact that it utilizes multiple networks to find the best signal is brilliant. I've had fantastic coverage everywhere and I don't even feel like I've had any blank spots. I mean... if you really wanted to I bet you could keep your phone bill down to like $25-$30 a month. Yup. I said it. It's totally possible. All depends on how you want to configure your lifestyle. Knowing that I'm paying for the MB's, yes MB's, I'm using vs just charging me for an extra GB is amazing. I shouldn't have to pay for what I don't use. If you're considering switching, ping and I think I have some sort of referral that hooks us both up. 

**TL:DR - Conclusion.**

Stop thinking about it. The Pixel 3 is the best daily driver for common use. If you're on the fence, jump over with open arms and run through a warm field of happy thoughts knowing you're joining a culture of free thinkers. An experience that isn't structured but designed to be made into your own experience. Rejoice! You'll be happy made the leap in more than one way. 

Got a question? Ping. Happy to answer. Cheers peeps!

I really appreciate getting a lot of questions as it helps me to help you, and as I've already mentioned, I'll try to answer anything I can now, too. 

I'll also answer everything once the embargo is lifted!"
GooglePixel,I love my Pixel 5,"I wanted to share my experience with my new Pixel 5. I see a lot of threads about all sorts of issues with this phone, but I think people are much more likely to be vocal when they're upset with a product. If a phone works like it's supposed to, people don't take to the internet to write about it. But I wanted to share my experience anyways to prove that issues are far from universal.

I bought my Pixel 5 after the battery on my 3XL really shit the bed (more on this in a minute). I've had it for about a week now, and I absolutely love it. Highlights:

**Build:** The phone feels fantastic to hold, especially without a case. For me, this is the perfect size. Everything is reachable, unlike the 3XL for me. I got the Sorta Sage model, and maybe it's just me, but this is one of the best looking phones I've ever laid eyes on. I adore it. The bioresin (plastic) coating feels good, not cheap, and not slippery. No fingerprints to be found.

**Display:** The 90Hz is fantastic. When I pick up my 3XL it feels like it's stuttering when I scroll. I'll never go back to 60Hz! If I REALLY pixel peep (as in, hold the phone 2 inches from my face) I can see that the Pixel 3XL has a slightly sharper display, since it has a better resolution. But the difference is only noticeable if I'm looking at hard edges of icons from extremely close distances. In any normal case, the display is great. Brighter than the 3XL too.

**Speed:** Who needs the best processor? I browse social media, chat, take photos, watch videos and play occasional games. Not once have I ever noticed this phone stutter or freeze. It is exactly what I need. If you told me it had a high end processor, I'd believe you. Unless you're a *hardcore* power user, this will more than do the job.

**Battery:** This is my favorite part about this phone. Granted, my 3XL battery was horrendous, but I love the battery on the 5. Just yesterday I unplugged my 3XL and my 5 at the same time (8am). I took my 5 on long 5 hour hike, taking lots of photos and 4k60 videos. When I got home, my Pixel 3XL had lost more battery from just sitting on the table. The battery like is a huge improvement! I have yet to end a day under 40%.

**Speakers:** The under display speaker gets a lot of hate for poor sound quality. When I compare to my Pixel 3XL, the 3XL wins, yes. But not once have I thought the audio was low quality. I regularly watch a lot of Youtube on my Pixel 5 and the audio has never been an issue.

In conclusion, I really enjoy this phone. The overall user experience is fantastic. It just works. Nobody asked for my review, but I just wanted to put some Pixel 5 positivity and appreciation out there. Very happy with my purchase."
GooglePixel,Pixel 2 to Pixel 5 = Fantastic phone!,"From Pixel 2 to Pixel 5 = Fantastic phone!

So much hate in this sub I thought I'd share my fanboy thoughts to help reverse the trend.  

I came from a Nexus One > Nexus S > Nexus 4 > Nexus 5 > Nexus 5X > iPhone 6s > Pixel 2 > Pixel 5. Been using the Pixel 5 for a little over a week.

Speakers - It sounds fantastic for music and podcasts. Better than my wife's iPhone XS. The XS sounds muted, heavy mids, hollow, while the P5 sounds fuller and with more detailed highs. Much more ""throaty"" than my P2. Okay technically it's not equal parts left and right channel, but for what it is, it's more than passable, especially in portrait. It performs like a component speaker where the bottom is your main driver and the top is a tweeter to fill out the highs. Yes the top speaker on its own sucks, like listening to just a tweeter without the main driver. I rarely make calls so that's fine to me (and your use case might be different and that's okay).

Processer - I don't game but take a lot of pictures. P5 is blazing fast for my needs. Sure there's a second longer picture processing time but that doesn't damper the experience. I take thousands of pics of my toddler and the camera keeps up with her running and jumping and dancing and craziness without skipping a beat.  

This thing is absolutely gorgeous with the thin, symmetrical bezels and lack of speaker grills in front to collect dust. It's the clean monolithic design I've always wanted. I personally would take this design over more powerful top speaker any day. And taking a half step down in processing power for a lower price point is exactly what I need from a phone. I don't want to pay $1000 for a phone.  

I didn't really like the phone in my first few days of use since it didn't immediately feel like much of an upgrade over my P2. I almost returned it. But with some more time I've grown to appreciate all that The P5 offers. The Pixel 5 still has the attention to detail of a top tier phone without the top tier price: the camera lenses are all centered perfectly with the cutouts in the front and back. The body lines where each piece connects are all straight and satisfying. The buttons are firm and clicky. The weight and feel in hand. The mirror finish on the G logo and power button. The centered and symmetrical placement of all the slots on the bottom. No complaints, this phone is fantastic! Bring on the downvotes."
GooglePixel,Siri in iOS 14 vs The New Google Assistant,
GooglePixel,"Anyone else having issues with ""OK Google"" only working on occasion?","It's been pretty faulty for me on my newish Pixel 3. Sometimes it's just delayed or muted for some reason and I don't realize it actually responded. Sometimes it responds but isn't actually listening to me, or only catches the last few words. Sometimes it just doesn't activate at all until I restart. When it works I love it, and it was reliable 80% of the time.

Now, however, it's not working at all, locked or unlocked. The squeeze works and so does just tapping the button. I tried resetting my voice profile and that didn't work. I restarted and then uninstalled Google app updates and reinstalled, set it all up again. Didn't work, so I restarted and that finally worked. A few hours later though and it's not responding again! Anyone else having issues or know another fix? "

GooglePixel,I had this video in my brand new Google Pixel 3 XL,
GooglePixel,"When my OG Pixel is ready to be retired, I may be abandoning the Pixel ship. Please allow me to share my perspective. Let's discuss.","I've been exclusively using Android and Google products since 2008, and I've really enjoyed the experience. Google has always felt like the forefront of powerful, configurable, and usable software, and with the introduction of the Pixel on Android 8, I genuinely felt content and loved the Android experience as seen through Google's eyes. The hardware felt right, amazing camera, smooth and user friendly software, and I could use the phone and software exactly as I saw fit.

However, things feel different now.

First, what is up with Android 9? I'm genuinely shocked at how many things have changed, and a lot of it seems like changes for changes sake; removal of WiFi/bluetooth quick settings menu, volume slider being changed, gestures are terrible, the recent apps screen feeling clunky, along with many other changes that seem like unnecessary feature cutting. I love software updates and generally look forward to them, but with Android 9, the direction feels off and the changes have no good replacements/solutions.

Also, how can essential apps be abandoned or neglected so often and so quickly? Hangouts being abandoned for the general user, messaging being a total mess, Inbox going away, and apps just generally being introduced and then abandoned without explanation or direct, better replacements. This concept of being introduced to software, just to be taken away some time in the future, is getting tiresome. I want to also point out Android Auto here, because it falls directly into this category of breaking often and being neglected, but I won't expand further because it's off topic.

Hardware. The headphone jack is a non-negotiable for me. I have expensive wired headphones that I use literally all day; so, I just can't listen and charge my phone at the same time anymore? That's it? Or I have to use terrible quality, spotty connection bluetooth now on new headphones? I have to rely on a dongle that is shoddy construction with high failure rates? Ok. If that's Google's answer for me now, their vision of mobile functionality does not align with me anymore. I guess I'll have to find hardware elsewhere.

The recent battery saver mishap. I'm surprised this isn't a bigger deal in the Android blogs and news sites. I'm okay with Google being able to push server side changes. Hell, I'm even okay with Google doing something like this as a test of a new feature (although less thrilled about it). But to have this happen, with absolutely no notification or announcement is craziness. I have the OS configured exactly how I want it, and if Google wants to change that configuration, at least let the user know that it happened. I missed important notifications due to this battery saver change, and to me, that's completely unacceptable. I simply cannot trust my phone anymore knowing that system settings will be changed without my knowledge. Again, if this is Google's vision moving forward with Android, I guess it's not for me.

Finally, I actually never saw this day coming. I guess I was naive, but after getting the OG Pixel, I really did think that I'd be sticking around the Pixel ecosystem for a looong time. With everything that has changed the last couple years, I just can't envision a path forward with the Pixel, and potentially even Android, anymore. That's really disappointing. I don't want to move on, but it's becoming increasingly clear that Google's vision of hardware and software just doesn't line up with what I feel like is a user friendly, stable, and interesting mobile experience anymore.

TLDR - I'm not finding myself aligning with Google's vision anymore. Please read the above though because I want other perspectives.

Edit -

Ummmmm, wow. I was not expecting this many responses. I just got a chance to really sit down and look at what others have said, and I have to say, I'm quite shocked at how many people are resonating with what I originally outlined. I honestly did not expect to bring these things up and uncover what seems to be an underlying and growing frustration within the Pixel community. Maybe I've been out of the loop, or maybe I've been avoiding the inevitable disappointment, but I really am sad to see I'm not alone here.

I know it won't happen, but I'd love to hear the perspective of a Google Community Director or someone about this. My intent with the post revolves around trying to understand how and why things got this way within the Pixel/Android ecosystem. Part of me is still grasping to the point that all of this may still be salvageable, if I just had visibility into the overall direction and reasoning behind the evolution; but I'm not hopeful I'll get that chance. If Android devs or community liaisons see this, please don't be afraid to address the community. A lot of us are here with genuine intent (and a love for Android) and are willing to listen with respectful and constructive insight.

Finally, I probably won't get the chance to respond to most of the replies, but I will be spending the evening reading through everyone's comments. This post wasn't just to complain or vent, and I'm curious to see what others have to say. I've been a member of other open source communities thoughout my life, and I'm totally willing to change my perspective and expectations if I'm presented with reasonable and fair rebuttals; hell, I welcome the opportunity to be convinced differently than where I'm at now. Depending on my availability, I may even try to compile a list of the common threads, including both positive and negative opinions."
GooglePixel,"Reports: Google, LG, don’t want Qualcomm’s super-expensive Snapdragon 865",
GooglePixel,The best thing about switching from iPhone to Pixel...,"I've had my Pixel 2 XL for over a year now and only JUST realised one of the best things about it: I've never thought about storage in the time I've owned this phone. The Pixels' free unlimited photo storage combined with the smart freeing up space is so good that I've just forgotten storage is even a thing. Just wanted to remind any other pixel owners that some of the best features are the ones you don't notice.

Conversely on all of my previous iPhones, I would constantly get intrusive pop ups telling me I'd run out of storage, or run out of iCloud (with no helpful option of 'clear iCloud storage', just 'buy more'). I had less tech-savvy friends who would just pay for more iCloud without even knowing what was on it, because they didn't know how else to get rid of the constant pop ups.

Anyway, have a great day."
GooglePixel,"As someone that works with their hands a lot, the Pixel 7 fingerprint sensor is useless","The tiniest little knick on your thumb and it doesn't work. The littlest bit of dirt and grime and it doesn't work. The smallest change in how sweaty your hands are and it doesn't work. Google got rid of external fingerprint readers (which companies perfected over the course of years) just to use a much inferior in-screen sensor as a marketing gimmick.

Honestly, I actually really like this phone. But I'm aggravated that I have to give up something my budget-conscious pixel 4a did exceptionally well... I assume one day that in-screen sensors will be great, but I'm at a loss of what their advantage over external sensors is."
GooglePixel,Does anyone prefer the 3a because of its plastic build?,I personally like the plastic build because of how much I tend to drop the phone.  Just yesterday I was in Walmart and I wasn't paying attention so my phone went flying before it crashed into the floor.  Surprising it survived with no damage.  Oh no case or screen protector.  I also like the plastic build because it's much more comfortable to hold.
GooglePixel,21 days of no Customer Service!,"****Update****
24 days total but only 3 days after posting here on Reddit and filling out a Reddit request and sharing on FB and Twitter, and sharing the post with the Google customer service representative, I have been issued a refund for the phone. They couldn't send me a replacement device because they did not currently have any in stock, and instead of dragging this out longer I chose the refund. I thank everyone one who shared their experiences and tried to help, and for the people who said its useless posting stuff like this here are wrong, It clearly helps draw attention to common issues a company has but do not admit they are common issues. It also gives people another avenue to pursue when their current options have stalled. I wont be 100% satisfied until I see the money back in my account which could take up to 10 business days. But once again Thanks!


I ordered a Pixel 3 XL for my wife's birthday, it arrived after an erroneous shipping delay and on a day that wasn't scheduled by FedEx ground, We signed for the package opened it up and there was no phone inside. Upon closer examination of the package you could see where it was cut open with a box cutter and re-taped. I immediately contacted Google and was told they would get back to me the next business day with the steps I would need to do to resolve the matter.  A few minutes later I received an email from Google support saying that there was nothing they could do and they fulfilled their part of of the transaction and they recommend I contact local law enforcement. Ofcourse I called back because this was not true they had not fulfilled their part of the transaction because I did not have a device in my package meaning it was taken by FedEx or someone at the Google fulfillment center (something that could have maybe been prevented by security tape which all major companies and carriers use instead of clear box tape like Google uses). Anyways after I called back I was issued a Case ID took pictures of the packaging , digitally signed a declaration that the package was empty and was told there would be an investigation. After 3 days I follow up because they said it usually takes about 3 days, no update, I follow up at 7 days no updates,  10 days no update. I call back an on the phone over an hour no update , they tell me they can't issue a replacement or refund until there is an update, I ask why it is taking so long no answer, today is 21 days since I reported this incident, no resolution in sight, I'm extremely dissatisfied customer service is non-existent, have several Google products and may just trade it all in over this. This post is a last ditch hope of some kind of customer service since I see some people have luck after posting."
GooglePixel,Fuck the pixel 5 gap. I'm in love,"I'm writing this with 47% at 9 am, when it was at 100% at 8am yesterday. INsane. Plus I put it in a case so the gap isn't an issue.

GooglePixel,Switched from Pixel 2XL to iPhone 12...tried hard but couldn't like it swapped out for Pixel 5 and couldn't be happier.,"Switched from Pixel 2XL to iPhone 12 why because all the online reviews/ influencers sold it hard to me...tried hard because of camera but couldn't like it swapped out for Pixel 5 and couldn't be happier.

Honestly after spending 4 days with IOS and iPhone 12 I can't fathom how someone can prefer this to pure Android on the Pixel unless they don't know better... everything felt slow and sluggish, slow scrolling, animations, notifications were horrible...no other way to say it really hated the software experience even the screen sucked( so yellow) only good thing was beautiful hardware and great camera last time I tried to switch was iPhone 6 and this was same experience as then was expecting iOS would have been leaps and bounds  better based on glowing reviews."
GooglePixel,What's the most annoying thing about owning a Pixel vs. an iPhone?,"For me... It's the fact that Pixel owners are so limited in cool phone cases.  I know this is ridiculous, but I hate going to websites for phone cases and they only make them for iPhones. Or how when I search, the Pixel is listed under ""Other Phones"". This ANNOYS me!  Probably more so because I'm a woman and I don't always want a black, clear or drab color of case. I always have to settle for questionable ones from Amazon that don't always have the best protection. Other than this, I've loved my Google Phone since Google Nexus days."

GooglePixel,Google are using a low quality OLED panel on the regular Pixel 6,"So I have seen quite a lot of posts from pixel 6 owners noting that they have a green tint and/or rainbow effect on white backgrounds. I myself had issues with the display on three different pixel 6's that I bought.

Just recently XDA released an article analysing the 6 and 6 pro displays and they confirmed the suspicions of many of us: Google are using a low quality oled panel (more specifically a rigid oled panel) on the regular 6 which is prone to bad viewing angles and tinting. In fact this panel is worse than the one on the pixel 5. 

https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-pro-display-review/

The author notes that this quality of panel really isn't acceptable at the $599 price and should have been priced $100 lower. The 6 pro on the other hand is using a top quality flexible oled LTPO that has great viewing angles and uniformity.

So for those are you having issues with your pixel 6 display it's really a case of whether you can put up with it or not, because these defects are simply inherent to the panel that is being used."

Think about it, you have a problem with the device, you'll be just left to take a rendez-vous and having them checking the issue in person. No stress.

Once you're getting a refurbished device, you will be straight in front of it to look if anything is wrong with it, if it's the case, again, the workers are right in front of it too, they cannot skip it or being afraid of being f*cked by a customer that has rocked his device without a case for 9 months and have just realised that this can cause scratches and want a new now (for example).

I live in Montreal, and I'm dead serious when I say that if I absolutely had to do an RMA, I'd gladly drive 2 hours to Ottawa or Quebec City and get it done once and for all like in an Apple Store and BASTA then waiting for one to be shipped.

GooglePixel,"We need to bring back custom vibration patterns for notifications, or at least more presets.","Years ago this was a capability and was removed in, what, like maybe Oreo? I can't recall. But given the onslaught of notifications and ways we use our phones these days, i find it absurd that Google hasn't come up with at least a minor range of standard vibration patterns available by default. Or at least the basic ability to create a few custom options. This is such a basic capability.

I don't even believe there are third party apps that do this (without root) anymore, since Google pulled the API as noted above, but i could be wrong/outdated. Plus that's not the point. Regardless, this is such basic, core functionality that i simply cannot fathom why Google hasn't improved it as they suggested they'd be doing when puking the custom notifications API (paraphrasing) years ago. I hung on forever as a Textra user just to hold on to custom vibrate tones until it was totally killed (worked for me for a year past the API being killed)

I hate a lot about iOS, but vibrate tones/patterns is an area it excels, despite basically everything else about iOS notifications being laughably inferior to Android. 

What do you all think? Am I the only one? I just want to know my SO had texted me based on pattern without having to grab my phone and check each time notifications that come in throughout the day, and this was always such a simple way to accomplish that. Thanks for listening...

GooglePixel,I miss the finger print reader on the rear of the pixel 2xl and how you could do the whole swipe down with it.,I used it so much. Even now that I have a 6 pro and I have had 4 xl since it the one thing I have missed the most. Even if they just had that feature back I would be happier. I damaged the screen a few days before the release of the 4xl and could still use the phone just by using that.

GooglePixel,Is it me or the pixel 4 xl speaker is so damn good?,"I've had my phone for about a week now. And one thing is noticed is that the clarity and crispness of the speaker is so god damn good. It's like there is a pleasure to hearing sound through it. That sounded weird but damn. I've been trying it with Amazon prime videos, Netflix , Spotify. The sound is sooo much of an upgrade to my pxl 2."
GooglePixel,"Google and Framework making an upgradable Chromebook, starting at $999",No Pixelbook but I guess this is a consolation. Very expensive starting price though...
GooglePixel,Pixel features drop is meaningless if you don't live in the US,"This is just a rant

I knew that as someone who doesn't live in an English speaking country I will miss many of the pixel features, but I'm still annoyed by how USA centric the pixel experience is."
GooglePixel,"Google Pixel OG lawsuit, up to $500 for microphone issue",
GooglePixel,"Google, why do we NEED a massive navigation bar?","I absolutely hate having this thick black navbar *always* at the bottom of the screen. 

For one thing, it should at the very *least* be hideable. For another, it should not even be there at all as that *is the entire point* of a gesture system. That tiny little pill is all that needs to obscure anything at all. 

It artificially gives the phone a massive chin which is so the opposite of what anyone wants.

GooglePixel,Google will fix Pixel 6 Pro ‘display residual light’ flickering issue with December update,
GooglePixel,"Just a moment...Android Q is here for the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3, and Pixel 3 XL",
GooglePixel,"[Exclusive] New Google Pixel 6 renders reveal dual cameras, flat display, and more",
GooglePixel,Sent Pixel 3 to be repaired; offered refurbished device for $450,"My Pixel 3's battery died. I was unable to charge it or turn it on, so I sent it in through Google's repair program. I put down battery life issues because I'm 90% sure it just needs a new battery. 

They charged my card $80. I assumed they were just going to install a new battery and send it back. Instead, I get a message stating ""Take action by December 5th."" I check it. They ""inspected"" my phone and found it had ""battery life issues,"" the one I listed, as well as ""charging port damage,"" and a ""power problem."" So they offered me a replacement for $465.00 + tax. 

The phone had no charging port issues. I never had a problem with it and only wirelessly charged it. On top of that, I don't even know what a ""power problem"" is. I just wanted a new battery.

What really ticks me off is that a refurbished Pixel 3 costs around $180-$250 everywhere else on the internet. I bought it new for a little over $500 from Verizon. Like I said, I was already charged $80. If I take their offer, I'll be paying more than what I paid new in total. I'm through with this. 

I loved my Pixel 3. Even after it died a week out of warranty I was willing to pay to put a new battery in it. I'm sorry Google, but I'm not paying $500 to get a ""fully refurbished"" 2-year-old phone. 

TL;DR: Wanted battery replaced, got charged $80, and offered a $465 refurbished Pixel 3 instead.

Update: Got Galaxy S20, love it! Google says i wasn't charged, hoping it was a temporary hold. Waiting for bricked pixel 3 to be returned."

GooglePixel,Google Must Act Quickly To Avoid Another Pixel Bud Disaster,
GooglePixel,"Received two defective refurbishes, this one has stolen blacklisted IMEI directly from google, no one cares can't get help","Started having problems with my pixel 3 months after buying. Had to wait a while to return due to living in rural Utah without possibility of g giving up a phone access. Finally did it, and they sent me a fried motherboard refurb. Broken out of the box. I was forwarded to special customer agent, who emailed me a few times then ignored me for a week. Finally they sent me the labels to send it back again. Now, 2.5 weeks later I receive a stolen/blacklisted IMEI refurb. My verizon account get's locked for trying to activate a stolen phone. Rep on the phone tries to tell me that google goes through a rigorous screening blablabla, but a simple google search confirms that this IMEI is blacklisted. No one at google seems to care. I missed work opportunities becuase my line was frozen this morning at a time when I am out of work. Best they could tel me is try to send it back again and hope for a better refurb next time. How many times am I going to do this? I refuse to trust a refurbished phone from google at this point. Even if it makes it 14 days after that I'm left out to dry if any serious problems reveal themselves. They give me a phone that works for two weeks and they are totally off the hook even though it's junk? I don't think so at this point it's clear their refurbished are not to be trusted. I really need them to send me another phone asap, a brand new one that won't have these major issues. They said a specialist will get back to me in 3-5 business days. Seriously? Finally I contacted them again today and they said a rep will get back to me within an hour, still waiting. Is there no one at google I can go to who would actually care? The problems I sent the phone back for are the same problems I was having when I first bought it, if I knew waiting to return it would get me a refurb I definitely would have done it then, I guess that's on me. But I also never would have guessed that a certified refurbished phone could be stolen, have a fried motherboard etc.  I'm sure this is a criminal issue on the part of google if it was looked into. Recasing old phones with fatal flaws and calling's them refurbished....how could they not know? Didn't they get sued for this a while back with the older pixels?

UPDATE: Spoke with ""supervisor"" LJ  #34212

did not seem to care at all but did say ""I am the last person you will speak to about this"" Told me there are no quality control departments that will want to hear about this, there is no one else who he can forward this case to. Offered to replace with another refurb by the same method, mail in wait etc. Is adamant that 

""as far as google is concerned this phone is not reported stolen""

And I asked him ""what do I do if I just keep getting these trashed phones?""  he said I will have to just keep sending them back. And I'm like ""are we really just going to keep doing this?"" he said he guesses so"

GooglePixel,Tensor: Details of Google Pixel 6 series-bound custom silicon potentially revealed in new leak,
GooglePixel,Google's Vision of Android is Still the Best!,"EDIT: Just to be clear, this is only MY opinion fellas

Last October, I decided to trade in my Pixel 4 for a Galaxy S20 FE thinking that it would be a faster more enjoyable phone, and also I had battery issues with the 4. Sure the phone felt quick and snappy at the beginning but after a couple months, the phone was feeling very sluggish. I think the culprit of this is actually OneUI's heavy focus on ""extra features"" on top of Android. Bottom line is I wasn't happy.

I decided to look around and found a refurbished Pixel 4XL on Swappa for $239. At that price I thought it was a steal, so I proceeded to buy it. After two weeks of usage, I'm glad to say it's good to be back. I loaded the Android 12 Beta 1 and the phone just as snappy as I remember!

It's not all about the spec sheet fellas!"
GooglePixel,To everyone who pre-ordered the Pixel 4...,"Call me petty, but this was my first time pre-ordering the Pixel 4 (previously I've only used iPhones). I wasn't aware of the Black Friday deal and I don't know, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way that the phone was $200 cheaper a month and a couple of days later after I bought it.

Anyway, I called Google, explained to them that it was cheaper and they gave me a $100 gift card to the Google Store. Everyone who pre-ordered received a $100 promo gift card, so this is Google's way of giving us our $200 off.

When I called I didn't have to fuss or argue with anyone, simply stated that it was cheaper and they took care of me.

GooglePixel,Number 1 best seller,I just realized the Pixel 3a is the number 1 best selling unlocked phone on Amazon. I hope this continues for people to enjoy the Pixel experience and know more about the pixel brand. #Teampixel😀
GooglePixel,Ambient EQ is a killer Pixel 4 feature and no one is highlighting it,"Ambient EQ is by far my fav pixel 4 XL feature and no reviewer is discussing it. I think it's incredible what a flat and paper-like effect it gives the screen and makes text super easy to read. And, almost no other Android phone has this feature (save for the LG G8 thinq afaik). I'm jealous that apple has had their similar True Tone displays for much longer. I now want all of my devices to have this. But why is no one talking about it? Seems like a huge differentiating factor that adds a ton of value imo"
GooglePixel,Google would have to give the Pixel 1 Android updates until 2021 just to match Apple and the iPhone 5s.,The iPhone 5s was released in 2013 and just got iOS 12 this fall which means it's been updated for the last 5 years now and could continue being supported a 6th year because Apple has not officially killed it. Meanwhile Google would need to keep updating the pixel 1 until 2021 just to match that.
GooglePixel,Unpopular Opinion: The Soli Radar and Face Unlock on the 4XL was amazing. (And I want it back on the Pixel 7),"I see a lot of hate in articles and forums about the Soli Radar on the 4XL but it was actually one of my favorite features of my 4.  I never used the motion based song skipping or navigation because I thought it was a gimmick BUT the phones ability to silence the ringer or the alarm when you go to reach for it was awesome and definitely felt like the future. Additionally it allowed the phone to spin up the face unlock feature  which gave you almost instantaneous unlocking of the phone surpassing apples face unlock by a mile at the time. (Usually my phone would be unlocked by the time I had picked it up and was ready to use it, unless a mask got in the way) 


I knew the 5 was a budget phone so when the Soli Radar was not included I was not surprised. I was however very surprised and a bit unhappy to see it had been excluded again in the P6P. I am really hoping they bring it back for the P7P."
GooglePixel,"If you have a Pixel 2/XL, you have until tomorrow to use the unlimited original quality backup to upload pictures.","I uploaded pictures from my DSLRs and newer phones with a USB-C adapter and an external drive, it took some time, but it was worth it.

GooglePixel,December 2021 Update Paused - Pixel 6,
GooglePixel,Google Camera 7.0 leaks from the Google Pixel 4 - Here's what's new,
GooglePixel,Here's a really quick & easy camera trick for interesting / dramatic wide angle shots,"This is what it looks like - https://photos.app.goo.gl/gL1JVvHB9SYctp41A

This is how to achieve it -

1) activate the front facing camera

2) the person taking the photo holds the phone with the top edge of the phone touching the ground, so that the camera lens is only a few millimetres from the floor

3) the person taking the photo stands behind the phone with the  screen facing the subject. The person taking the photo bends down to look at the screen to check the composition, but ensuring that they aren't in frame

4) once the shot is lined up, shoot a few snaps

Variation - instead of having someone else take the photo, lay the phone on the floor with a jacket or something underneath so you can easily adjust the angle. Put the camera in timer mode (3 sec delay), fire the shutter and get everyone in to position for an unusual selfie (this is how we did the Ferris wheel photo.

This is why its such a useful technique -

1) the front camera is a much wider angle than the rear camera, so you can fit a lot more into the field of view (great for big buildings etc in the background)


2) placing the top of the phone parallel with the ground ensures that you always get level photos


3) facing the camera screen at the subject allows them to position themselves better (like you can when taking a selfie)


4) having the camera low on the floor can produce dramatic results and is an unusual perspective that's hard to do in the traditional way (unless you lie on the floor, but who wants to do that?!). 


Here's why you probably shouldn't use it all the time -

1) the angle is sometimes unflattering - tends to work better if the subject is further away

2) mix it up - this is just another tool in your arsenal - don't over-do it!


Hope this helps / inspires!

Edit - thanks for all the nice comments and feedback :) I added a photo of my gfs 4 year old cousin to the album. I think this technique works well on animals and kids because it's generally better to take shots from their perspective (or close to)."
GooglePixel,Use Chromecast in Hotels via Hotspot without using your Mobile Data,"I was delighted to discover a feature of the Pixel that solves the problem travelers have when trying to use streaming devices like Chromecast on hotel TV's....many hotels set up their wifi such that Chromecast doesn't see the phone.

The solution to this is to set up your own WiFi hotspot and drive the Chromecast from it. This works fine but all the internet guidance on this tells you that this will eat your mobile data allowance fast. Well it might on lesser phones, but not on the Pixel series if the hotel wifi works. Pixel (versions 3 onwards) will feed the hotspot from the wifi connection so it acts as a wifi repeater. (No third party apps are required to do this).

Using the Hotspot makes it easy to use Chromecast with same settings in any hotel room. Get the phone onto the hotel wifi, turn on your hotspot, set up the Chromecast to the hotspot, and cast away. Turn off mobile data to confirm it's running via wifi. When the Chromecast is set up to work off your own hotspot it will work right out the suitcase in next hotel with no reconfiguration needed."
GooglePixel,"Google Camera hints the Pixel 6 XL could have a 5X ""ultra tele"" camera",
GooglePixel,From the Pixel 3 to the 5 - a couple of things,"1) The 5 is almost EXACTLY the same dimensions as the 3. 

2) Without a case it's kind hard to tell where the fingerprint sensor is because everything's the same texture, but thankfully muscle memory is a thing.

3) I was very curious what the texture felt like and I cannot believe no one has said this before IT FEELS LIKE PAPER. Paper-textured plastic. I quite like it. 

4) The USB-C port is smaller and allows for a tighter fit, which is nice.

Mostly I just needed to share that it feels like paper."
GooglePixel,I made a (crappy) video to prove that the Pixel Imprint page can be used to quickly learn your fingerprint profile.,"So, [in this thread's comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dnthw3/p4_can_you_really_only_register_1_face/f5gcph8/), I had a discussion about how there is no need to create multiple profiles for the same finger, and that the phone will learn and improve the same profile as reads your finger multiple times. u/eminem30982 insists that there are no reliable sources out there to say that the ""Pixel Imprint"" page can in fact, be used to learn your fingerprint. Yet he refused to test it himself to see if it works or not for him.

So, in order to prove a point, and to stop people out there giving advice to create multiple profiles in order to improve accuracy, I created [this crap quality video](https://youtu.be/XO0Zscps8tM)

Let me just start by saying I'm no cameraman, and I had to record this on my tablet, as I had to film myself using the Pixel 2.

A short explanation on my methodology. I wanted to prove that it is possible to expand my finger profile all the way to the first bend of my finger, despite only using my fingertips when initially creating the profile. 

In order for the phone to not register parts of my finger, I used masking tape to cover the bottom half of my finger when initiating the new profile. After that, I covered the top half of my finger and while and used the exposed bottom half to test that my finger wasn’t recognised.

I removed the tape, then I proceeded to repeatedly tap the sensor while moving my finger up and down so the phone can learn the bottom half of my finger. When that was done, I covered the top half of my finger again and used the bottom half to test, which my print was recognised successfully.

After that, I removed the tape, locked my phone (using the power button) then proceeded to unlock my phone, first with the tip, then again with the bottom part near the bend. A reminder that I only used the tip of my finger when I first created the profile.

Sorry about the bad video quality, hope this helps people out there with fingerprint accuracy problems.

Edit: I realised I should've tried to unlock the phone first straight after profile creation while having the tape covering the top half of my finger, in order to better show that the bottom half of my finger wasn't recognised."
GooglePixel,Pixel 4 on At&t!!!!,
GooglePixel,Google to update Pixel 4 face unlock with eye detection ‘in the coming months`,
GooglePixel,Mishaal Rahman - These images of an alleged Google Pixel 4 just started floating around on Telegram. No idea of the true source or if they're legit.,
GooglePixel,Clean your USB-C port!,"I cleaned mine today after dealing with a loose connection for a couple of months.  I had figured that something became loose inside the port because it didn't look dirty.  Boy was I wrong:

[https://i.redd.it/79iesas532521.jpg](https://i.redd.it/79iesas532521.jpg) (Swiss Army toothpick and Fi sim for scale)

This is probably less than half of what came out, most of the crud fell to the floor.  The dust/dirt really gets compressed in there and just when I thought I was done, I'd pull up another big ball of crud.  I've only had the phone since April.  

The toothpick from a small Swiss Army knife was the perfect tool for this.  It's plastic, thin, and flexible enough to go around the ends.  I've read elsewhere that a can of compressed air is helpful too, but as compressed/compacted as my dust was, I'm not sure that would have helped. 

&#x200B;"
GooglePixel,Pixel Update Pledge,"[OnePlus has announced](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23484102/oneplus-android-updates-2023-phones-extends-support-period-select-models) that it's matching Samsung's update policy of 4 OS updates & 5 years of security patches for devices released in 2023 and onwards. Why isn't Google able to offer the same to its first party Pixel devices, especially now that its reliance on Qualcomm has ended?"
GooglePixel,My Google Pixel 7 Pro Outshines my iPhone,"Ok Google, you made this one right.

After purchasing the iPhone 14 Pro Max, I found myself feeling disappointed and unimpressed. The iOS platform seemed stagnant and uninteresting to me, and Apple's reputation as a ""great"" software company fell short.

As I researched and watched more reviews of the Google Pixel 7 pro, I was impressed by the advancements in technology and design since the Pixel line. It was so tempting that I made the switch to the Pixel 7 pro one week ago and what can I say beside : I am absolutely blown away by its features, the AI-powered features, sleek user interface, and seamless integration with Google's apps and services. The screen is top-notch, the camera is just gorgeous, and the ecosystem is fantastic. I'am completely in love with this phone and can't imagine going back. 

THIS phone is why Android is now far away from it's competitor. It's just too good. Thanks Google for creating such an impressive device."
