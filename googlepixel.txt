                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Google's lack of global warranty on Pixels is behind the competition and a shame

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Idea: Pixel phones plugged to a monitor should enable chrome os

I WON! Pixel 5A had black screen issue, Google refused to honor warranty after uBreakIFix couldn't repair the device after 3 attempts. It would continually display "Radio Off" and the phone wouldn't make calls - I wrote a letter to Investor Relations and Tweeted @MadeByGoogle with 0 followers

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Switching to Pixel was the best decision I've made.

                                                                                                                                                                                                            Anyone else feel like their swipe texting accuracy on the G-keyboard goes down over time?

                                      Today I received a message reaction to a text! Rather than being notified that a message was "loved" by an iphone user. The emoji showed up on the text itself! When I tapped on the emoji, it said it was translated from an iPhone. It was nice for a change.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Handing my pixel 3 to an iPhone user always cracks me up

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Does anyone else think Google Pixels are really bad at screen rotation?
                                                                                                                                                                                                         I'm seeing more iPhone bias in social circles recently. The pressure to switch really sucks.

                      FedEx driver left phone(with label clearly stating signature required) on my front porch and never even rang the doorbell.(video showed she just dropped the package and left) So how can FedEx tracking show that I signed for the package? It shows "Signed for by: DKARAJAN"

I WON! Pixel 5A had black screen issue, Google refused to honor warranty after uBreakIFix couldn't repair the device after 3 attempts. It would continually display "Radio Off" and the phone wouldn't make calls - I wrote a letter to Investor Relations and Tweeted @MadeByGoogle with 0 followers

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The Greatest Text I've Ever Received.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Am I the only one who wants a small Pixel?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     All those "exclusive first look at pixel 6" videos gotta stop...
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Pixel 4A is phenomenal. Thank you Google.
                                                                                                                                                                                            After 116 days of waiting, Google have informed me that I'm not going to get my Bose headphones after all
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Update to trade in value being changed to $17.50
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Why did Google get rid of the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Those using Android 10, are you keeping Dark Mode on all the time now?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I now understand why people become fans of Pixel phones
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Have had my Pixel 3a XL for less than 24 hours, Here's some Surprises and Thoughts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Android 10s dark mode is still half-baked
                                                                                                                 My OG Pixel XL died over the weekend. Went to bed and when I woke up, she didn't. Went and got the Pixel 4 XL and I've never had an easier time transferring my data from my backup.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It's 2019, why does it cost $100 to go from 64gb to 128gb on a phone?
                                                                                                                                                                                             Mods, can we please just pin the known issues Instead of people constantly posting about the same stuff?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Phone is weirdly hot
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My experience so far with the Pixel 5 coming from a Pixel 3
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Think we'll get an MKBHD Pixel 6 review tomorrow?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Pixel 6 Pro after 1 month
                                                                                                                               I don't understand this desire for a bezel-less phone. Especially when the alternative is a notch or camera cutout. The FRONT of the P4 looks much better than the 3XL
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I will never get a phone from another manufacturer again
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Google discontinues Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL less than a year after launch
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                MKBHD gives the Pixel 6 Value Phone of the year award
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Finally got my Pixel 2 XL today! Only it was missing one thing...
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Google working on ‘Fast Share,’ Android Beam replacement and AirDrop competitor
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When you restart your phone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     No chargers in box is idiotic idea to save money
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Disappointed in the size of the Pixel 6?
                                                                                                 Hold on -- If the 6A won MKBHD's survey... taking pics like the 5A... which takes pics like the 4A... does that mean there's a used $160 Pixel out there taking better pics than a new $1600 iPhone?
                                                                                                                                                                                                        Can we all agree that the blurr-out notification shade is way better than a blank background?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Google shipped my new phone via FedEx Ground, driver thought it was via FedEx Air

                                                                                                                               I don't understand this desire for a bezel-less phone. Especially when the alternative is a notch or camera cutout. The FRONT of the P4 looks much better than the 3XL

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Just got my hands on a pixel watch
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I wish Google would release another *small* phone
                                                                                               According to the Google Store's own trade-in program, the 2017 Pixel 2 has depreciated almost 3 times as much as the 2017 iPhone X. $265 value from switching to Google vs just $61 for staying loyal.
                                                                                     Anyone else love getting flashbanged by the 7's fingerprint sensor in the wee hours of the morning? If my finger isn't square in the sensor or it doesn't authorize on that first touch I'm suddenly wide awake.
                                                                                                                                                                                                     If you're going to take out the headphone jack can you give me an aux to USB C dongle in the box
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Pixel 6 gave my wife some peace of mind
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Found a very odd glitch
                                                                                                                                                                                                             So every time I flush the toilet, my P6P shows me that Rumor Has it by Adele is playing.
                                                                                                                                                     I didn't know if this had been posted here, but the Pixel 4 XL beats iPhone Pro Max in speed test and Ram management was really impressive also.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Excited for a new phone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Can Google accept that I'm not interested in sports?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Went to Best Buy, tried to find out the differences

                                                                                                                                                                      Perhaps my biggest annoyance with Android 12 is how expanding lock screen notifications draws down the entire notification tray
