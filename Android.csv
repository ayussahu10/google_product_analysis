Android,Chinese Spyware Pre-Installed on All Samsung Phones (& Tablets),"I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.

For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).

This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r/samsung](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/) and [r/galaxys10](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.

For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.

If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo\_360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360)).

If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.

With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \[dot\] cn, wshifen \[dot\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https://imgur.com/EtfInqv](https://imgur.com/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.

Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).

I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.

After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.

Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?

This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.

**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  
To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them."

Android,"I hope Pokémon GO will stay around for years to come. Not because of the game, but because it demands a good battery.","A notable amount of people already bought new phones just because they wanted to get to play Pokémon GO, so that's something.

But the thing is: that shit requires a good battery. My 3 year old S4 drains its self empty really quickly if I keep the game open while walking, and I know that's an issue with newer phones aswell. The big difference between Pokémon and other mobile games is that you'll play the game in places with no way to recharge your phone, and you often play for extended durations at once (instead of just log in, 2 min taptaptap, turn off).

Now in theory, if someone plays that game and is going to buy a new phone, it's more likely that they'll add ""need a really good battery"" on their list of ""features I want""... and as such, in the long run, phones with great batteries will sell more.

Which will, hopefully, lead to companies spending more time developing battery technologies since it's now a bigger selling point than before.

Or maybe they'll just start marketing portable chargers for Pokémon players and nothing else happens because the players will already have their extra battery with that, and they don't need a better phone battery anymore.

I don't really know what I'm talking about, just a showerthought.

TL;DR Pokémon drains battery. Players will buy more phones that have good battery. Companies start focusing more on battery power."

>YouTube may terminate your access, or your **Google account’s** access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.

While this wording is (probably intentionally) vague, it could mean bad things for anyone using ad block, YT Vanced, etc if Google decides that you're not ""commercially viable"". I know that personally, I would be *screwed* if I lost my Google account.

If you think this is not worth worrying about, look at what Google has just done to hundreds of people that were using (apparently) too many emotes in a YT live stream chat that Markiplier just did. They've banned/closed people's entire Google accounts and are denying appeals, and it's hurting people in very real ways. Here is [Markiplier's tweet/vid](https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/1193015864364126208) about it for more info.

It's pretty scary the direction Google is going, and I think we should all reevaluate how much we rely on their services. They could pull the rug out from under you and leave you with no recourse, so it's definitely something to be aware of.

EDIT: I see the mods have tagged this ""misleading"", and I'm not sure why. Not my intention, just trying to give people the heads up that the ToS are changing and it *could* be bad. The fact that the verbiage is so vague, combined with Google/YouTube's past actions - it's worth being aware of and best to err on the side of caution IMO. I'm not trying to take risks with my Google account that I've been using for over a decade, and I doubt others want to either. Sorry if that's ""misleading""."

Now, I couldn't care less about what features the iPhone has or doesn't have. I use an Android phone. What I do care about, is that Android phone manufacturers have a bit of a reputation for blindly copying Apple in hopes that making the same mistakes as Apple will make them successful. But I digress.

When you think about it, this situation seems eerily similar to the headphone jack going extinct: Apple realized, that they could make a lot more money by selling expensive Bluetooth earbuds, rather than cheap wired ones, so they removed the headphone jack. And soon, nearly every other manufacturer followed suit.

What I'm afraid of, is that the same thing will happen all over again; Apple removes the charging port, creates an expensive, proprietary wireless charger, and others follow along a couple years later.

Now, you could argue that removing the charging port is just so utterly ridiculous, that no other manufacturer would be insane enough to remove it. But, isn't that exactly what we said about the headphone jack?

My point is, that if Apple does end up removing the charging port, we have to make it damn clear to our favorite phone manufacturers, that we won't let them get away with it. Otherwise, there is a high chance history will repeat itself."

Includes every resource I used, simple explanations and an interesting first app tutorial. Everything you need to get started in Android Development is here.","A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I’m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience.
 
[Here is a link to the old post, in case you’re interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1w3woc/a_step_by_step_guide_about_how_to_get_started_and/)
 
##There are two ways of approaching this post:

1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you’ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it.
2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills.
 
**What is Java?**
 
Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable. 
 
**Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language**
 
This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables.
For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:
 
    String name = ""Dennis"";
 
    String surname = ""Cometti"";
 
    String FullName = name + "" "" + surname;
 
 
After this runs, the variable FullName will equal “Dennis Cometti”.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0).
 
I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)

Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a ‘Quote’ Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person.
 
**A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English**
 
All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:
 
    String name = ""DENNIS"";
 
    name = name.toLowerCase();
 
 
It couldn’t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted “DENNIS” (""dennis"") to the 'name' variable.
After you have typed ‘name.’ Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance.
 
**Classes, methods and objects in Java**
 
•     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain “Dennis” and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89.
 
•     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView.
 
•     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car.
 
•     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects.
 
**So what is the difference between classes and objects?**
 
A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template).
An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car).
 
A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template).
An object would be a ‘name’ (containing the String “Dennis”).
 
If you are confused, don’t worry, once you have followed the instructions you’ll understand it much clearer.
 
**Some Java related resources**
 
- [The basics of Java](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)
- [The syntax of Java](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm)
 
 
##How do you get started making an app? 
 
**Get Android Studio**

Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don’t let the words confuse you – it’s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You’ll come across many things you don’t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn’t need them for this exercise).
 
#Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK]( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)

#Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don’t open it yet.]( https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
 
**Strings in Android**

Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.
[Here’s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail]( http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html)
 
**How Android Studio works**

Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won’t be using many. When you create a new ‘Project’ (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project.
[This screenshot shows what it generates](http://i.imgur.com/HOX9B7S.png)
This looks quite complex but it’s actually quite simple. For example the ‘layout’ folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you’ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.
 
 
 
 
 
#####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.

>

 
#Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button.

 
#Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project]( http://imgur.com/a/o7NdR)

 
#Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](http://imgur.com/JM4BIMV.png)

 
#Instruction #6:
The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this: http://pastebin.com/pRisAsPF

This has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from “Tap the screen to begin” to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color.
 
#Instruction #7:
Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class: http://imgur.com/a/3I7v9

You’ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now.
You will see ‘public class Quote{}’, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code: http://pastebin.com/VhHbWwSN 
Just click OK to any popup boxes.

What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you ‘instantiate’ the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon.
 
#Instruction #8:
Click on the Quotebook class here: http://i.imgur.com/bG2d0VD.png
Then copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside: http://pastebin.com/wz8gbWWA

You’ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable/line: int count = 0;

This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted: http://pastebin.com/3FXi14XZ
 
 
 
 
 
#Explanation time!
 
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);
 
    RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);
    final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);
    final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);
 
 
The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.

____________________


     final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();
 
     Quote quote1 = new Quote(""You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck."", ""Troy Barnes"");
     quoteList.add(quote1);
 
     Quote quote2 = new Quote(""Cool Beans"", ""Rod Kimble"");
     quoteList.add(quote2);
 
 
The first line here creates an Array/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called ‘quoteList’.
 
The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person’s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.

____________________


This is where it gets a little tricky:
 
    touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
 
                if (count < quoteList.size()) {
 
                   Quote q = quoteList.get(count);
                   quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());
                   personText.setText(q.getPerson());
 
                   count = count + 1;
 
                } else{
 
                    count = 0;
 
           }}});
 
 
This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.

*If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again.
If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*

If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.
 
 
 
#Instruction #9:
Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled ‘values’ and ‘values-v21’, they should both contain a file called styles.xml
In the ‘values’ folder, change the parent= value to be:

    parent=""android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar""
 
In the ‘values-v21’ folder, change the parent= value to be:

    parent=""android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar""
 
This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes.
 
#Instruction #10:
To do this next step, you have to:
- Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed.
 
- [Enable Developer Settings](http://www.greenbot.com/article/2457986/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) then enable USB Debugging.
 
- Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio/ADB)
 
Then, you have to click the [green play button](http://i.imgur.com/cOkY2Ep.png), the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app!
 
If you have issues here, Google your phone + abd drivers/android studio.
 
#Instruction #11:

**Libraries**
 
Libraries are like pre-made bundles of code that you can use instead of coding everything yourself.
For example the IO Commons library  contains a huge range of methods that manipulate files in one line, like copyFile(), moveFile() and getExtension() instead of having to do them manually.
There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the navigation drawer on older devices.
 
Android Arsenal is a great site for finding Android Libraries:
https://android-arsenal.com/
 
And here is how to add them to Android Studio:

**More advanced Pro-Tips**
 
- Stack Overflow is a fantastic community if you have any development questions - but Google it first.
- Check out /r/androiddev
- Follow Google Design Guidelines.
- If you don't really understand some code or how to do a particular task, Google it, comment what you are trying to do and ask around.
- Use libraries wherever you can.

Android,**[Moderator Post] Announcement: Subreddit Lockdown in Protest of Reddit's New API Policies and the Threat to Third-Party Apps**,"Dear members of r/android,

We hope this message finds you well. Today, we have an important announcement to make regarding the future of our subreddit. After much deliberation and in response to recent developments, the moderation team has made the difficult decision to lock the subreddit as a form of protest against Reddit's new API policies and the potential threat to third-party apps.


##**Why are we implementing the subreddit lockdown?**

As passionate moderators of this community, we strongly believe in the power of third-party apps and their integral role in shaping the Reddit experience. These apps have provided countless users with unique features, enhanced usability, and diverse interfaces that have enriched their engagement with the platform.

However, recent changes to Reddit's API policies and the potential threat of limiting or even phasing out third-party apps have raised concerns within our team and the wider Reddit community. We believe that these changes may hinder innovation, limit user choice, and disrupt the vibrant ecosystem of apps that have flourished alongside Reddit.

By going private, we aim to draw attention to this issue and demonstrate our collective opposition to the potential consequences of these policies. We stand in solidarity with the developers, users, and moderators who rely on third-party apps to connect, share, and engage with Reddit in unique and valuable ways.

----
##**I don't use 3rd party apps, why am I being punished?**

We understand that this temporary restriction may cause inconvenience, but we hope that by taking this action, we can shed light on the importance of maintaining a healthy and diverse ecosystem of third-party apps. It is not only the user experience that is at stake; the impact of these changes can also affect moderation tools, accessibility, and the helpful bots that have become an integral part of reddit. If you use the official reddit app, we encourage you to try to understand the benefit these apps bring, and the parity between the official and third parties are leagues differing.

----
##**What should you expect during the lockdown?**

During this lockdown period, the subreddit will be set to private for 48 hours starting June 12th, 00:00 UTC [time conversion](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20230612T000000&p1=137&p2=3919&p3=179&p4=233&p5=1440&p6=136&p7=111&p8=176&p9=236&p10=248&p11=240). You will not be able to interact with the community at this time. We will evaluate our stance after 48 hours.

----
##**How can you join the protest?**

If you share our concerns and wish to voice your support for third-party apps, we encourage you to actively participate in discussions across Reddit, engage with developers, and express your opinions to the appropriate channels within the platform. Let your voice be heard and help raise awareness of the vital role that third-party apps play in shaping the Reddit experience.

Thank you for your understanding, support, and solidarity during this crucial time.

Best regards,

Android,The direction Google is heading in is frustrating as a consumer,"Many of us are frustrated at the release of Allo and it got me thinking, I'm tired of Google. Their philosophy of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks is infuriating. They kill apps that could be great (Google Wallet), or they just don't put 100% of their effort into them and then act confused on why they fail. Allo needed one thing to be successful and Google **STILL** didn't listen. 

The Pixel phones seem to be focused on the average consumer, but they can't even make a messaging app that the average consumer wants to use in the first place. The rumored price point seems incredibly high for what the phones appear to offer and they can't even update their phones on time which brings me to my next point.

Google can't update their own phones reliably. Android N had months of beta testing and the rollout was still a trainwreck. Nexus 6 owners are  angry and there are still massive battery-draining bugs in the final release. It takes the Android  update system thats already in a poor state and makes it look even worse. Sure iOS10 had a bumpy start as well, but Apple has been fixing the issues consistently. Meanwhile Google is radio silent about the whole issue and has yet to fix any of the bugs that has plagued Android for years. 

Finally, Google has appeared to completely have forgotten about Material Design. It's one the best looking design languages but they don't even follow their own damn guidelines 50% of the time. Look at the new Pixel Launcher. It looks convoluted and doesn't appear to match any other design Google has. Youtube seems to change its design every week so I'm not even sure what they are trying to accomplish. Then there's the Play icons (Doritos) that don't even come close to matching MD. I know it's just ""guidelines"" but the idea was to unify a design language on Android so that things were familiar from app to app, and that's just not the case. 

I love Android, I really do but I'm just frustrated by Google's choices and they don't seem to have a clear vision of what they want Android to be.  Apple actually knows the direction they want to take iOS, while providing amazing support to all of their devices. They makes dumb decisions also dont get me wrong, but I feel like they have less drawbacks than what Google is doing currently with Android right now. /rant

Android,"Samsung ""space zoom"" moon shots are fake, and here is the proof","**This post has been updated with several additional experiments in newer posts, which address most comments and clarify what exactly is going on:**

**[UPDATE 1](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11p7rqy/update_to_the_samsung_space_zoom_moon_shots_are/)**

**[UPDATE 2](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11r7dwk/last_update_on_the_samsung_moon_controversy_and/)**

Original post:

Many of us have witnessed the breathtaking moon photos taken with the latest zoom lenses, starting with the S20 Ultra. Nevertheless, I've always had doubts about their authenticity, as they appear almost too perfect. While these images are not necessarily outright fabrications, neither are they entirely genuine. Let me explain.

There have been many threads on this, and many people believe that the moon photos are real ([inputmag](https://www.inverse.com/input/reviews/is-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-using-ai-to-fake-detailed-moon-photos-investigation-super-resolution-analysis)) - even MKBHD has claimed [in this popular youtube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6P1VRs68Cqo) that the moon is not an overlay, like Huawei has been accused of in the past. But he's not correct. So, while many have tried to prove that Samsung fakes the moon shots, I think nobody succeeded - until now.

**WHAT I DID**

1) I downloaded this high-res image of the moon from the internet - https://imgur.com/PIAjVKp

2) I downsized it to 170x170 pixels and applied a gaussian blur, so that all the detail is GONE. This means it's not recoverable, the information is just not there, it's digitally blurred: https://imgur.com/xEyLajW

And a 4x upscaled version so that you can better appreciate the blur: https://imgur.com/3STX9mZ

3) I full-screened the image on my monitor (showing it at 170x170 pixels, blurred), moved to the other end of the room, and turned off all the lights. Zoomed into the monitor and voila - https://imgur.com/ifIHr3S

4) This is the image I got - https://imgur.com/bXJOZgI

**INTERPRETATION**

To put it into perspective, here is a side by side: https://imgur.com/ULVX933

In the side-by-side above, I hope you can appreciate that Samsung is leveraging an AI model to put craters and other details on places which were just a blurry mess. **And I have to stress this**: there's a difference between additional processing a la super-resolution, when multiple frames are combined to recover detail which would otherwise be lost, and this, where you have a specific AI model trained on a set of moon images, in order to recognize the moon and slap on the moon texture on it (when there is no detail to recover in the first place, as in this experiment). This is not the same kind of processing that is done when you're zooming into something else, when those multiple exposures and different data from each frame account to something. This is specific to the moon.

**CONCLUSION**

The moon pictures from Samsung are fake. Samsung's marketing is deceptive. It is adding detail where there is none (in this experiment, it was intentionally removed). In [this article](https://mspoweruser.com/fake-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-moon-shots-debunked/), they mention multi-frames, multi-exposures, but the reality is, it's AI doing most of the work, not the optics, the optics aren't capable of resolving the detail that you see. Since the moon is tidally locked to the Earth, it's very easy to train your model on other moon images and just slap that texture when a moon-like thing is detected. 
 
Now, Samsung does say ""No image overlaying or texture effects are applied when taking a photo, because that would cause similar objects to share the same texture patterns if an object detection were to be confused by the Scene Optimizer."", which might be technically true - you're not applying any texture if you have an AI model that applies the texture as a part of the process, but in reality and without all the tech jargon, that's that's happening. It's a texture of the moon.

If you turn off ""scene optimizer"", you get the actual picture of the moon, which is a blurry mess (as it should be, given the optics and sensor that are used). 

To further drive home my point, I blurred the moon even further and clipped the highlights, which means the area which is above 216 in brightness gets clipped to pure white - there's no detail there, just a white blob - https://imgur.com/9XMgt06

I zoomed in on the monitor showing that image and, guess what, again you see slapped on detail, even in the parts I explicitly clipped (made completely 100% white): https://imgur.com/9kichAp

**TL:DR**
Samsung is using AI/ML (neural network trained on 100s of images of the moon) to recover/add the texture of the moon on your moon pictures, and while some think that's your camera's capability, it's actually not. And it's not sharpening, it's not adding detail from multiple frames because in this experiment, all the frames contain the same amount of detail. None of the frames have the craters etc. because they're intentionally blurred, yet the camera somehow miraculously knows that they are there. And don't even get me started on the motion interpolation on their ""super slow-mo"", maybe that's another post in the future..

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes (and awards), I really appreciate it! If you want to follow me elsewhere (since I'm not very active on reddit), here's my IG: [@ibreakphotos](https://www.instagram.com/ibreakphotos/)

**EDIT2 - IMPORTANT**: New test - I photoshopped one moon next to another (to see if one moon would get the AI treatment, while another not), and managed to coax the AI to do exactly that.

This is the image that I used, which contains 2 blurred moons: https://imgur.com/kMv1XAx

I replicated my original setup, shot the monitor from across the room, and got this: https://imgur.com/RSHAz1l

As you can see, one moon got the ""AI enhancement"", while the other one shows what was actually visible to the sensor."

Android,'Swiping' to delete a song is ruining my Google Play Music experience,"EDIT: Here's a better example: https://streamable.com/l6hvq

I know I don't scroll 100% vertically but I don't think anybody does. Doing the same in other apps does not result in 'ghost swipes' like this. Also, notice how the last ""undo"" button disappears really quickly.

We all know that the google Play Music Android app is not very aesthetically pleasing or very user friendly but you can get used to these things and I have done so over the past 3 years.

However, there is one thing that is now making the app even more annoying: You can swipe songs to delete them from playlists - at it is very easy to do so without trying.

I can't remember how long this has been going on but I can say that I've deleted a bunch of songs from playlists without know which song it was. And exactly this happened right before I decided to record this video. The 'undo' button disappears as soon as you touch anywhere else on the screen so when you're quickly scrolling through a playlist this happens very often.

Here's an example of how you can scroll quickly through the playlist you've created and accidentally delete songs:

https://streamable.com/wz9h9

I compare it with another app, 'Relay for reddit', where you can also swipe left or right on tiles to do an action. 
In Relay you don't get accidental swipes left or right like you do in the Google Play Music app. How hard is it to fix this, Google?

Edit: I know the video isn't the best example but I was being a little cautious since I didn't actually want to delete any songs because it's a hassle to find them again sometimes.

And while I'm adding to the post I want to let you know that I just deleted a song because I wanted to scroll all the way down to the bottom of one of my playlists 😢"

I was thinking to myself, ""Why dont routers come with NFC stickers for pairing your devices? Why don't car phone mounts come with NFC for connecting your phone to your car stereo? Why doesn't everything use NFC to connect to everything else?"" 

One of my favorite features was the ability to easily Bluetooth pair things. No more ""what's the device name?"" ""Why isn't it showing up yet?"" ""What's the connection pin?"" Just.. *touch* and you're done

Then I realized because if manufactures started pushing NFC, only android users would be able to take advantage of it. Even tho iPhones have NFC chips, they have them restricted to payments only. It's really frusterating to me, our phones already have the chips, it already only costs cents to make the tags, yet the technology goes mostly unused

EDIT: I know iPhones can pay with NFC. That's not the point. I'm saying they should be able to do more then just payments."

For example, a paid app, with lots of reports for abandonment and bugs, that hasn't been updated for 12 months shouldn't be there.

**Edit3**: I think that some people still misunderstand what i have said. To sum it up: i do not want to force any developer to keep updating his app forever. But when a developer decides to abandon an app and this creation gets buggy due to that (or not working at all), it shouldn't be available for new purchases. Google Play could freeze new purchases until the developer decides to support his application further. Also, for those who say that this would end up being a way to troll devs, i can wrongly flag any app as inappropriate, anytime. I guess that's what Google is for, to examine on a case-by-case basis. Sorry, i can't respond to every comment separately, since many of you post the same thing (but i respect your opinions). But i do believe that many of you are developers with an app that hasn't been updated for a long time, still working though. Don't get offended by my comment, i'm not referring to your apps. Read edit2.

Android,"About a month ago, my Galaxy S4 caught on fire. Samsung told me that they would replace it. They have ignored me completely since then.","29 days ago I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/294qj5/i_woke_up_because_something_burned_me_while_i_was/) post, talking about how my phone had burned and melted while I was sleeping. I was using the official battery and a samsung cable when it happened, and my phone was not under any blankets, or under anything at all for that matter.  
  
Within a couple of days, Samsung had contacted me and told me that they would send me a replacement S4, and a box that I could use to ship my destroyed phone back to them in. During this time they were extremely cordial and polite, and seemingly wanted to genuinely help me. I was happy to oblige, because its only a matter of time until someone loses their life because of this issue. However, Samsung never sent me a replacement phone. Only a box to ship my phone back in.  
  
I have tried multiple times since then to contact Samsung via phone, and through their Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter accounts and have been completely ignored. When I call them, I generally am able to speak to a representative for a total of 5 minutes, and then I am placed on hold for about 30-50 minutes before either my call is disconnected, or I am transferred to a voicemail where I have left multiple messages.  
  
I don't know what route to take in this matter, so here I am again, hoping to get their attention again this way.

---
Edit: Some spelling

Also, to those saying that I should ""wage war"" against Samsung, I would rather go about it in a more diplomatic way than that. I want to give them the chance to do what they feel is necessary. If I feel that it is not, then things may be different. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here, and hoping that a proper solution can arise without a bunch of nastiness.  
  
---  
Edit 2:  
  
A few people have stated that I should send my phone in. I have asked Samsung multiple times when I was able to get in touch with a representative, ""What needs to be done in order to resolve this situation?"" Not once has any of them said that Samsung was waiting on me to send in my phone. If that were the issue, then I am certain that they would have let me know, as I am sure they would like to get their hands on my phone to try to find out what went wrong.  
  
Also, Samsung told me that they would ship a replacement phone out with the box for me to send my phone back in. The purpose of my calls to Samsung, when the replacement phone never arrived, was to find out why it didn't arrive. During these calls, again, Samsung never stated that they were waiting to receive my phone before they sent a replacement.  
  
The fact that they told me that they were going to send a replacement phone out and then did not, combined with the lack of help that I have received in my attempts to communicate with them, have degraded my trust in Samsung.  
  
Another thing for the people suggesting that I send it in, as I stated in my original post, the phone has some functionality still, though I have to to some cable Judo in order to get a charger to properly connect in the charging port, due to the misshapen nature of the charging port that occurred when it melted. If I were to send it in, I would be without a phone, and I cannot afford to run out and buy a new one.  
  
Finally, please try to keep it civil everyone. I know that some of you guys are die-hard Samsung fans, and that is ok. I really enjoyed my s4 up until the point where it melted and burned me and I didn't receive proper customer service after the fact.

Edit 3: The fine folks over at HTC have [made me an offer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2bsgkf/about_a_month_ago_my_galaxy_s4_caught_on_fire/cj8rq8c) that I couldn't refuse! I'm honestly in awe of the amount of support and suggestions that I have received in regards to this issue. You guys and gals are all the best! I will update this thread with pics, so if anyone is still around when I receive my replacement, you can see them.   
  
I really cannot express the amount of gratitude that I have for those of you who offered help and advice for all of this. All that I can say is thank you very much.

Android,The Magisk Story,"The last time I used reddit was posting a PSA in [/r/pokemongodev](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongodev/comments/52j80f/hello_im_the_developer_of_magisk), which is over a year ago. Recently I started to use this site more frequently, and I'd love to chime in and share some stories I *personally* found interesting. Not sure if anyone would be interested in me and the BTS of Magisk, but I'll share it anyways lol, it also helps me refresh my memory.

### Who Am I?
I'm a 22-year-old Electrical Engineering student from National Taiwan University. You can find me under the ID *topjohnwu* everywhere. Behind Magisk there is no corporation, no massive development team, no professional developers, it's just me, a passionate student that happens to know some coding :D. Starting as a noob, then writing scripts, all the way to developing Magisk, I consider myself far from a pro. I'm still learning how to properly write programs in general, learning the way to manage such large scale projects, and learning how Android works as AOSP is still pretty much a mysterious box to me. 

### Inspiration
It all started from [Chainfire's Marshmallow Systemless SuperSU](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=63197935&postcount=2) (2015.10), at that time I was fascinated and immediately took the boot images and zips apart, becoming one of the first to [port it on a non-Nexus device (M8)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/htc-one-m8/general/root-root-marshmallow-gpe-supersu-t3242210) (2015.11). Root became systemless, but I use Xposed and that modifies system, can I fix that? I tried migrating CF's Systemless scripts for Xposed but in vain: the bind mounts happens too late. I dug into my device's `init.rc` and [official docs](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/init/README.md) to understand how `init` boots the system, and after tons of newbie effort I finally found out that `post-fs-data` is the earliest possible boot stage with `/data` access and happens before `Zygote` starts (which pretty much means everything). As a noob it took me half a year to make this concept into reality and released [Systemless Xposed](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/unofficial-systemless-xposed-t3388268) (2016.6). In my personal opinion it was a pretty significant breakthrough and maybe sparked excitement to many users.

### The Birth of Magisk
Since the release of Systemless Xposed, I started to get requests from developers to help porting their mods to work systemless-ly. I turned down many devs because the mods requires adding files into the filesystem, which is impossible with only using bind mounts because mounting won't work with a non-existing ""target"". A workaround did come across my mind (still the very core concept of Magisk), and I shared this idea with [Captain_Throwback](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=1162986), the first Magisk user and avid supporter since day one. He encouraged me to actually put this into practice, so I spent my summer vacation in front of my computer hacking up a [complicated script](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/v7/zip_static/common/magic_mask.sh) to create a so-called ""Systemless Interface"". Along with a combination of CF's `supolicy`, phh's `sepolicy-inject` and `bootimgtools` for handling SELinux and boot image extraction, Magisk is finally released to the public (2016.8).

### The SafetyNet Battle
At that time, people were complaining that rooting breaks Android Pay. I briefly looked into the issue and found out that it was actually pretty easy to trick SafetyNet at that time. I introduced an extremely primitive method to bypass the checks and bundled it with Magisk. Since then the everlasting battle between Magisk and SafetyNet has started, and the detection rules and policies gradually became more and more stricter. Additional techniques are required, more hacks are added, and some major redesigns to the whole project has been done along the way. I won't go into the details here or this post will be 3 times longer :p

### Pokemon GO Craze
I have to thank this game for Magisk's publicity LOL. PoGO added SN checks in one of its updates, and *swarms* of rooted PoGO players flooded the XDA thread to bypass SafetyNet checks. This was the point when my personal project thrived with a drastically increased user base, and I started to take things seriously. Without this initial boost, I'm not sure how long it'll take for people to recognize my project :)

### The Beef: Controversy
I asked Chainfire in the very early stages of Magisk for some help with SELinux but rejected because he wouldn't share his ""intellectual properties"". With no knowledge in SELinux, I decided to cut a corner in the first few releases and used SuperSU's `supolicy` to patch sepolicy. Due to modifications required in superuser for SafetyNet bypasses and the fact that SuperSU is closed source, there is no way to modify SuperSU and it was incompatible with my SN workarounds. To make things worse and more complicated, CF went on a vacation and I couldn't contact him for adjustments, so this made me turn to the open source [phh's su](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/wip-selinux-capable-superuser-t3216394) and modified it to work with Magisk. Obviously once CF was back from vacation, he was very upset about me using his work to promote the open source competitor. This of course was 100% my negligent and shows my immatureness. ([Chainfire's response](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=68453946&postcount=1169) (2016.9))

However, I was actually also pretty pissed by the situation. Chainfire took my `post-fs-data` discovery and added it into SuperSU without any credit, and created an obvious competitor to Magisk's SN bypass feature, [suhide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/supersu/suhide-t3450396), which relies on running stuffs in the `post-fs-data` stage. For a well experienced developer like him, my discovery might seem like nothing, but as a newcomer it actually took me months of research to figure it out. Later he also distributed my Systemless Xposed zip without my permission to promote his Xposed SN bypass capability of suhide. Ironically enough my effort ended up taken by the ""big guy"" for exploitation to attack me. In one of his posts he also publicly [express contempt for ""that sort of mod""](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71561057&postcount=9345), obviously targeting Magisk, as ""a few lines of script"". Overall, I was wrong in the first place, CF didn't really hold me liable for the violation, and also I didn't really want to stir drama, so this was never publicly addressed until now.

I'm not sure if there were any misunderstanding between us. I would say this was a pretty unfortunate situation from the beginning, and my immatureness is a huge part to be blamed.

### Integrating Superuser
Very soon I spent a full month learning SELinux, getting ideas and help from phh, developing and enhancing the open source sepolicy patching tool and finally released the fully open source Magisk v7 with all previous releases removed for copyright reasons. Without knowing the secret within `supolicy`, I used a different approach to overcome SELinux. Due to the complications of SafetyNet hiding, treating superuser as an extension was not really that viable, so upon entering 2017, I used the whole month of the Chinese New Year Holiday to fully integrate phh's superuser and done many improvements to modernize the implementation. Magisk officially became a complete rooting solution, attracting users for the open source nature and SafetyNet hiding efforts.

### Final Words
If you managed to stay at this point, thank you for your attention :) The rest of the pieces of Magisk's history could be found in my announcement thread, as I tend to be very chatty in all my release notes (and of course including this post :p) 

2017 was really an incredible year, I learned **a lot** in development, Magisk was massively and rapidly improved, and also it gained quite an impressive user base which I could never imagine. Pretty funny is that I bet very few people remember the fact that initially Magisk was only for the systemless interface and never meant to stumble upon the whole SafetyNet business, which eventually led it to become a rooting solution.

I can't be more grateful to Android's open source community as I learned how to do Linux programming from the code of phhusson's superuser and the complete suite of the tools. I am also fortunate to have a group of passionate developers and testers across the globe willing to help me with development and sometimes guide me towards the correct direction. This is why I always keep my work open source, because I believe people should share knowledge to inspire others, just like how I am personally inspired from others to create Magisk.

Looking forward to the future of Magisk in 2018!"

Apple has recognized the power that iMessage has to attract and keep users within its ecosystem.

a. As early as 2013, Apple decided not to develop a version of iMessage for the Android OS. (Cue Dep. 92:22-93:1.)

b. Mr. Cue testified that Apple “could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS” such that there would “have been cross-compatibility with the iOS platform so that users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly”. (Cue Dep. 92:5-9; 92:11-16.)

c. However, Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering and the executive in charge of iOS, feared that “iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove \[an\] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones”. (PX407, at ‘122.)

d. Phil Schiller, an Apple executive in charge of the App Store, agreed that Apple should not offer iMessage on Android devices. (Cue Dep. 92:18-93:1.)

e. In 2016, when a former Apple employee commented that “the #1 most difficult \[reason\] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage . . . iMessage amounts to serious lock-in” to the Apple ecosystem, Mr. Schiller commented that “moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why”.

Some bits from the article:

*When Google tested versions of its Android operating system that made privacy settings easier to find, users took advantage of them, which Google viewed as a “problem,” according to the documents. To solve that problem, Google then sought to bury those settings deeper within the settings menu.*

*Google also tried to convince smartphone makers to hide location settings “through active misrepresentations and/or concealment, suppression, or omission of facts” — that is, data Google had showing that users were using those settings — “in order to assuage [manufacturers’] privacy concerns.”*"

It turns out she read out a snippet from an email I received from a family friend soon after my Dad's death. But the fact that she knew to say it was pretty staggering, it was in the 3rd paragraph of an email sent to me back in December 2010.

Google knows everything, but I'm not scared of it knowing everything quite so much anymore.

After replacing the default apps sold with their phones with adware-filled ""alternatives"", after adding those applications into a security update to force them onto the users, after adding a series of fake five star reviews... now comes the time for the forced five star ratings.

In their [Calculator application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tct.calculator), Alcatel now forces the users to [rate the application with 5 stars, before using the scientific calculator options](https://i.imgur.com/yMlrAx3.png). Sometimes, I wonder if they simply try to come up with new ways to break their customers' trust just for the fun of it. 

**Updates**

There are a few updates I'd like to make to the original post, based on some things that changed and comments on the thread.

* Regarding the comments that this is not an Alcatel application: this was the application that, up until it was removed, was replacing the stock calculator application in Alcatel phones when updating it (that's how I ran into it, as I have an Alcatel idol 4, and other Alcatel users already commented the same in the thread). Replacing the stock apps with these shady versions is something that Alcatel has been doing for a few months: [news item @Slashgear](https://www.slashgear.com/alcatel-apps-just-went-adware-on-us-29517407/), [news item @AndroidPolice](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/01/29/default-gallery-app-alcatel-phones-replaced-spamware-users-angry/)). Unfortunately, this is really tied to Alcatel, even though there's a gmail email account as a support link - which also happens in [other Alcatel applications](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tct.gallery3d).

* It seems that the unlock worked even if the users rated it with less than 5 stars (I didn't test unlocking it with a lower rating, but there are a few reports of this in the thread). However, since the unlock message clearly stated that 5 stars were required, the vast majority of users was rating it with 5 stars (while leaving comments saying that they were doing it only to unlock the features). This is still against the Play Store's ToS (and a very shady thing to do).

* The application seems to be gone from the Play Store. It is also no longer showing in my Idol 4 (as of this morning).

* In my Idol4, the update notification for the other Alcatel stock applications has disappeared. I'm not sure if there's any relation to this situation. Up until now, I had update requests for all the stock applications to turn into their ""spam"" alternatives, but now they're not even listed under my installed apps. Can other Alcatel users confirm if the same is happening to them?

* The developer seems to have a [second version of this calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tct.calculator2) currently up. I'm not sure what's different or if it also has the rating demand. However, this second version doesn't seem to replace the stock app when updating OTA on Alcatel phones."

I sent in my phone to Samsung and they received it on the 20th of October. It has been 26 days and I have not received a refund or any sort of useful information.

When I initially sent in the phone I was told it would take 2-3 business days. Then when 3 business days came it got pushed to 3-5 business days and well you get the picture.

It has now been 26 days since they've had possession of my phone and not a single person at Samsung can explain to me why I have no received a refund or whether I am even getting a refund. All the managers I've escalated the situation to have told me ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do, you just have to wait.""

Samsung does NOT care about its customers, all they want is to get their phones back and not refund you for them. 

I am not alone, on the Note 7 subreddit and xda-developers no one has received a refund yet either.

I want to get the word out there to let everyone know how Samsung is treating its loyal customers. Please never buy Samsung again. People deserve better.

edit: The most frustrating part is how Samsung has no answers. Every representative or supervisor I've spoken to the last 3 times has told me they don't know why I haven't received my refund and they have no way of investigating and finding out why. I've worked in customer service before and it boggles my mind that they think it is acceptable to just tell a customer ""I don't know."" and that's the end of it.

edit2: There is a thread on the android central forums with plenty of people in the same situation as me. No one has received their refund or answers. http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-7-returns/726774-second-hand-note-7-recall-thread.html

edit3: I see a lot of people telling me to do a charge back. That would just screw over the original person who sold the phone to me, not Swappa. The Note 7 is being recalled for safety concerns, so whether I bought it from Samsung, Swappa, or a man in a parking lot, they are responsible for it. They are the ones pushing every user out there to return their Note 7s as soon as possible, so they have to take responsibility for making things right.

If you bought a used car from someone and the car exploded while you were driving (due to a manufacturers defect) are you going to hold the person who sold it to you responsible? or the manufacturer of the car?

My father is 78 years old, he's living alone, he fell the other day and was unable to reach the phone. He is now fine, but of course I am worried about him. I go to bed around 11pm, while he goes to bed around 1am. So I set an alarm for 12:59am, to pre-wake me, and automated the call process to be directly on speakerphone (my phone charges on the night stand beside my bed). This way I know if he doesn't pick up, I need to head over and check on him. 

Thank you android, for being so completely capable of handling these circumstances. I tested it for the first time tonight and it worked beautifully. I'll rest easy knowing my dad is alright and I didn't have to lift a finger to do it. "
Android,Google Will Not Allow OEMs To Hide Information From Battery Stats In Marshmallow,
Android,"Google resumes its senseless attack on the URL bar, hides full addresses on Chrome 85",
Android,Sync for reddit (including Pro) is Injecting Amazon Affiliate Tags into your Amazon Clicks,"**tl;dr - Sync for reddit (including Pro) is injecting their own Amazon affiliate tags into every Amazon link you click within the app.  There is no option to disable this**

While discovering this, I was using v11.6.5 of Sync for reddit (Pro)

I first unknowingly discovered this 9 days ago but this likely has been around for much longer.  I was going through my hidden posts on Wednesday of this week (Sync automatically hides reported posts) and decided to look at one that I reported for including their own affiliate code (it was in a subreddit specifically to buy things and disallowed affiliate tags) to see if it was removed.  It wasn't.  The first comment was by a mod in response to my report saying there was no affiliate code in the link.

I know there was when when I checked it out.

I checked out the link again, using Sync, and there it was in plain site.

> tag=fheuivhierfiu-20

How could the mods not have noticed this?  That is when I decided to go to my computer and see if my browser is showing the same URL.  Keep in mind, I have already disabled affiliate links in my reddit preferences in my browser so there are no Reddit affililate tags being added to my outbound clicks.

It wasn't; the URLs were different.  There was no affiliate link; the mod was right.

I then started trying out all of the Amazon links I could find using Sync.  They all had it; the same affiliate code.  All of these links were posted in different subreddits by different users.

Before creating a post in their support subreddit (/r/redditsync), I tried searching and looking in their FAQ if they made any mention at all about affiliate tags.

They didn't.

I then tried to create a text post asking about it, making sure to use the correct flair and information.  This post was automatically removed by AutoModerator due to their filtering rules. It was probably because my post included their own Affiliate tag, but which filter exactly? I have no idea as I have messaged them to find out why and have not received any reply from them.

The post I created can be seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsync/comments/4yfxo7/question_is_sync_automatically_injecting/

---------------------------------------------------------

**For anyone using Sync, you can see this for yourself by using the link below.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/4ycp6z/amazon_steam_controller_35_50/

When opening the link, first open the Amazon link within the app.  Once the Amazon page has loaded, then choose ""Open in Chrome""

You'll see the following URL: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016KBVBCS?tag=fheuivhierfiu-20

If you open the URL on your desktop's browser, you'll see the following link instead: https://www.amazon.com/Steam-Controller-SteamOS/dp/B016KBVBCS/ref=sr_1_2?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1471532042&sr=1-2&keywords=steam+controller

Now some of you may be okay with this, supporting the developer by clicks.  I understand that and I have supported them in my own way by purchasing the Pro version of the app.  I can understand if they put their affiliate code in the free version.  Personally, I don't believe the affiliate code should be used unless they are the person directly influencing the purchase of the item; that's why I disable reddit's Affiliate links.  The person that deserves the bounty is the one who has posted the link.

At the very least, there should be an option to disable this.  Instead it's being hidden with no way to disable it."

Android,"When Facebook bought Whatsapp the FTC said:- ""We want to make clear that, regardless of the acquisition, WhatsApp must continue to honor these promises to consumers."" - Time to step up?","So when Whatsapp was bought by Facebook, Whatsapp at the time had been making loads of promises about privacy, that they'd never sell out etc and got loads of users off the back of this before doing exactly what they said they wouldn't.

As part of the deal to buy Whatsapp the FTC stated the following:-

""WhatsApp has made a number of promises about the limited nature of the data it collects, maintains, and shares with third parties — promises that exceed the protections currently promised to Facebook users, we want to make clear that, regardless of the acquisition, WhatsApp must continue to honor these promises to consumers.""

""Before changing WhatsApp's privacy practices in connection with, or following, any acquisition, you must take steps to ensure that you are not in violation of the law or the FTC's order,""

Apparently they then laid out 3 guidelines to avoid issues:

First, if WhatsApp eventually starts using collected data ""in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the promises WhatsApp made at the time of collection,"" **it must obtain affirmative consent before doing so.** The company is also forbidden from misrepresenting the extent to which it protects WhatsApp user data. And finally, if WhatsApp suddenly changes how it collects, uses, or shares new data, the FTC is urging the company to let users opt out — or at the very least ""make clear to consumers that they have an opportunity to stop using the WhatsApp service.""

Now thats not what Facebook is doing - if you opt out your only opting out of the ads, NOT from sharing with the rest of the ""Facebook Family""

So - will the FTC step up and enforce what they promised they would?

Sauce - http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/10/5601878/ftc-issues-stern-privacy-warning-to-facebook-whatsapp

**EDIT1**:- Here another source on TechCruch with more quotes and info
https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/10/whatsapp-privacy/


> After the acquisition announcement, **WhatsApp wrote “Here’s what will change for you, our users: nothing** …. And you can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication.” **Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said “We are absolutely not going to change plans around WhatsApp and the way it uses user data”,** and **a Facebook spokesperson confirmed Facebook would uphold WhatsApp’s promises to users.**

WhatsApp’s most recent privacy policy (prior to sale) from July 7th 2012, states that:


    “WhatsApp does not collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users’ mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers”
    “We do not collect location data”
    “The contents of messages that have been delivered by the WhatsApp Service are not copied,
    kept or archived by WhatsApp.”
    “We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent”
    “We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent”

**EDIT2**: I see people below asking what can we do, that tech companies are getting off with this way too often. We need the tech sites to start picking these things up and running with them. Their voice on these matters is too quiet. They should be onto issues like this, asking Facebook and whatsapp for comment and making the case for us as well as getting the word out as to what is happening. Only by making everyone aware of what is being allowed to happen can this be stopped.

""*Upon further review of the provided information, we've accepted your appeal and have reinstated your applications. You will need to log back into your Android Developer Console to make the necessary changes and re-publish the application so it is available again on Google Play*.""

This post got quite popular, so there are chances that someone in Google might read it. What we're asking to Google is to stop this unfair practices by:

* Being more transparent about the suspensions processes; 
* To stop this life-banning madness; 
* To stop banning associated accounts. This is just crazy and often lead to very unfair situations;  
* To let us communicate with real people, and not stupid bots. I'm sure most of us here are willing to pay a fee for this service. 

If you're someone working in Google bring this topics up. If you're not working in Google **please share this story**. If you're working for the EU keep doing the good job and end this unfair practices. "

The screengrab Snapchat takes from the viewfinder is highly compressed while the Instagram photo shows minimal compression. This is due to superior software that talks directly to the camera API. 

I know there's a lot of negativity surrounding IG Stories and how it's a blatant rip-off of Snapchat, but I fully support IG's addition of this feature. Snapchat is a mess on Android and hopefully IG will motivate them to actually put effort into their app.

Android,I don't think OnePlus is the only Android phone that has problems calling 911...,"Was told I should post this as a separate post:

My S7 Edge refused to call 911 for me the other night. I saw a car flip off the interstate and I tried to call 911. My phone literally rebooted twice when I tried to call emergency services. It tried to show me an emergency services screen or something? But the phone just kept freezing and rebooting. When the police station also called back, my phone would _not_ let me answer, it just froze up. Luckily I flagged down another driver to call for help. 

I haven't done anything weird or different to my phone, so I'm fucking pissed at Samsung and/or Google. What if I had been dying or something and needed help? Extremely ridiculous, it should be like the number 1 priority for a functioning phone. 

Had anyone else ran into those issues when trying to call 911? I fear that if I have to call when someone's life is on the line, a phone I paid nearly $800 for isn't capable of doing so.

Response to comments and clarification

* How I tested: DiscoMark benchmarking app (available in Google Play) (it does everything automatically, no need to get your hands dirty). I chose 15 runs. 
* Reboot before each run to keep things fair
* Tested apps: 20 Minuten, Kindle, AnkiDroid, ASVZ, Audible, Calculator, Camera, Chrome, Gallery, Gmail, ricardo.ch, Shazam, Spotify, Wechat, Whatsapp. Reason: I use those apps often and therefore they represent my personal usage-pattern. Everybody can use DiscoMark to these kind of experiments, and they might get different results (different phones, different usage patterns). That is how real-world performance works.
* The absolute values (i.e. speed-up in seconds) are rather meaningless and depend heavily on the type of apps chosen (and whether an app was still cached or not). The relative slow-down/speed-up is more interesting."

Android,My nexus 6P was stolen today.,"I am one of those dumb people that uses my phone as my wallet. So I have my employee card, along with my bank card and my ID-card with the phone.

I took the bus today after the gym, used my phone on the bus, since my phone holds my buscard. I stood up the entire ride, since the bus was crowded with people. I didn't notice the guy sliding his hand into my pocket and nabbing my phone. So I walked for two minutes, on my way home after hopping off the bus to come to the terrible realisation that I've been robbed.

So, panic sets in. This guy now has my bank card, my ID card (which means he has my full social security number) amongst other things. So I run home like a maniac. I know that i've not ""dropped"" my phone, I somehow knew that i've been robbed.

Fast forward: I'm home and I ask my boyfriend to call my cellphone. My boyfriend's name on the phone is ""*authentic name* (Boyfriend.) "" 
Two signals in and the guy clicks me. I try again and he's constantly clicking me. At this moment, panic sets in. Then I remember that google has this neat feature where I can track where my phone is. I sit down by the computer, lo and behold, my phone has made it's way to some place 20 minutes away from my home. I call my friend and asks if he's able to drive, he agrees.

I grab my friends phone and log in to the google service and spam call my phone through there, just to be an annoyance. We arrive outside a house, knock on the door and there's a woman in her mid 40's by the door. She asks what's up, and I ask her if she has any children. She mentions that she has two son's and I ask to see them both, and explain the situation for her.

Well, the perp in this situation was the 16 year old son, who later on admitted that he had picked the phone through my pocket, and then panicked once he noticed that the phone kept saying ""Android device located"". The shock on his face when he saw me by the door was priceless, he actually didn't think i'd find my phone.

I want to point out that the  [Android device manager](https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager) is a great tool and that if you ever lose your phone, use it. It's fantastic!

Also, don't have all of your private cards attatched to your phone, use a wallet. I know I will from now on.

**Edit 2:** Yes, I am a boy, I know I wrote boyfriend in my story, You don't need to send messages to clarify if I'm gay or not, since that has nothing to do with the story.

I am not saying "" Go after the perp who's stolen your phone"" when you've located it on your android device, What I am saying is that it's a useful tool to have in order to track down your stolen phone. And it works if it's in your neighbourhood so-to-say. Or city, you name it. Because then you know most of the maps & places. Bad parts of town, etc."

&#x200B;

I am the developer of [Cytoid](https://cytoid.io), a community-driven music game released on Google Play and App Store. Similar to how ""osu!"" works, players can use a level editor to create levels for Cytoid. We don't want people to use Google Drive or Dropbox to share their levels, so we also host a level sharing website, [CytoidIO](https://cytoid.io), which runs independently from Cytoid.

&#x200B;

Earlier this month, some copyright holder has emailed us, stating that some of our user content on CytoidIO is infringing their copyrights. They also sent DMCA takedowns to App Store and Google Play as well, and Cytoid got removed from Google Play (App Store didn't remove it immediately but started a dispute process). Now, two things:

&#x200B;

1. They are filing a DMCA to Cytoid, which is technically unrelated to CytoidIO; yes, there is a link to CytoidIO in Cytoid, but that's all.
2. By [relevant DMCA laws](http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise33.html), service providers like CytoidIO are immune from liability of copyright infringements resulted from user content, as long as we follow some rules (automated uploading, no financial benefits, remove copyright-infringing materials expeditiously), which we all did.

&#x200B;

In fact, we quickly reached a resolution with the copyright holder, and they agreed to withdraw their DMCA notice from Apple. However, they claim that they couldn't withdraw from Google because Google doesn't provide an official way of doing it. (It is indeed true.) I then filled out and submitted the [DMCA counter-notice form](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_counternotice?product=googleplay&uraw=&hl=en) to Google, explaining about the situation. Two days later I got this email:

&#x200B;

>At this time, Google has decided not to take action. We encourage you to review [https://library.educause.edu/topics/policy-and-law/digital-millennium-copyright-act-dmca](https://library.educause.edu/topics/policy-and-law/digital-millennium-copyright-act-dmca) for more information about the DMCA.  
>  
>If you have legal questions about this notification, you should retain your own legal counsel.

&#x200B;

Fine. We then consulted a copyright lawyer and **wrote a formal** [**DMCA counter-notice**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EJGvIFV5YtkgXoZcw_3AZ1GJkjtK17Zc/view) **letter**, even mentioning some of the applicable DMCA laws. And just 30 minutes ago, I got the reply:

&#x200B;

>  
>If you have legal questions about this notification, you should retain your own legal counsel.

&#x200B;

The bots at Google don't seem to care about us.

&#x200B;

What should I do? Is this purely a bot issue, or there were some issues with our counter-notice letter? People online are saying to file a lawsuit to grab Google's attention, but I am only an university student and have no money or time. Please help.

[Cytoid on App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cytoid/id1266582726?mt=8) (our description on App Store is identical to that of Google Play, so I put it here to serve as a reference)

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:**

I just received an email from the removals team:

&#x200B;

>Thanks for reaching out to us.  
>  
>Pursuant to the counter notification you sent us, we have reinstated the following URLs:

>Apps may need to be republished in order to be visible to users.

&#x200B;

Judging from how fast they responded (it took more than 3 days in the past), I am pretty sure that wasn't a bot this time!

&#x200B;

To be honest, I literally teared up a little bit when I saw the reinstatement email. **From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much to everyone who upvoted, commented, shared the story, and provided insightful advice. I really, really appreciate it.** I know this incident alone is not enough to fully push Google into changing their attitude towards small developers, but hopefully it helped, even just a tiny bit.

&#x200B;

I have so much more I wanted to say, but I really have to go now! I will update the post tonight with more of my aftermath thoughts.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 2:**

So here I am, one day later. The main game is finally back on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tigerhix.cytoid), although our game servers (including the website) are currently under maintenance and will be back online on Friday morning.

&#x200B;

Regarding the game's future: obviously I will start publishing the game on more platforms, including F-Droid like many have suggested. **The reason why I didn't publish it everywhere was because we are a non-commercial open-source game** \- we don't earn money by reaching out to more users, so we wanted to make the game cater to a wider audience first. Currently, if you aren't a professional music game player, you won't find much fun in Cytoid: most of our fan-made levels are really, really difficult, so we are working to bring a proper learning curve to the game (like a progression of easy->intermediate->hard levels). We are also teaming up with indie artists to use their music in our game, giving more exposure to them and their work. You can follow our development on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cytoidio). (Most of the time it's just our mods joking around, though.)

&#x200B;

As for this incident - once again, I am truly grateful to /r/Android and everyone participated in this thread. From my email exchanges with some Google employees that contacted me, this Reddit thread definitely attracted Google's (or their PR bot's) attention. I might have to give up on working on the project if not with your help. You saved the dream of an indie developer. **Thank you. 🙏🏻**"

Android,"I was attacked and robbed, Google's ""Find my phone"" is worthless against thieves.","Long story short, I was attacked and robbed, and the attackers took my phone. Being the avid tech enthusiast I am, I knew google had a service to track, erase data, and more, but I had never used it until after the attack and theft.

So why is it worthless? It 100% relies on your attacker/thief being a complete moron. As soon as they can, they can turn on airplane mode, via the lock screen (works on 3 phones I tested), and that defeats it, or they can simply power the device off, either via a hard shutdown or software off. So essentially the only stock way of retrieving your phone or tracking the thief is stopped in 3 seconds with common sense.

So I propose an OPT-IN feature, that disables access to quick toggles when your phone is locked, or at least ones that disable this feature (airplane mode, gps, wifi, cell data). It also disables software and hardware shutdown at the *lockscreen*. Now this bit is admittedly going to be difficult for some to accept, which is why its opt-in, but the only time youd *really* need this is if your phone froze at the lock screen, which to me I havent suffered a hard freeze in 5+ years, but would result in you needing to wait it out.. Hence why it should be opt-in.

Another thing I take issue with is the fact that if your phone cant be tracked, you have to choose what you want to do. Wait longer and try to track it, or factory reset the phone. One leads to possibly finding the criminal, while the other secures your data. You shouldnt have to compromise here, there are numerous ways to fix this, but the answer should never be 'choose one'.

The firm’s name is Girard Gibbs and they are actively investigating this case and would like to hear from others that are experiencing problems with warranty service from Motorola. If you want to contact the firm, send an email to: eyn@girardgibbs.com.**   

Very briefly I will relate my interactions with Motorola over the past 2 months and try to keep it from being my personal story.  This is not a thread about one person complaining about the customer service they received.  But the ordeal I am going through with Motorola in order to execute a simple limited-warranty exchange lead me to discover a much bigger issue.

Motorola simply can't honor the warranty on their devices because they don't have replacement devices in stock.  

 I know for a fact that they have had no stock of the Moto G 3rd Gen, The Moto X Pure Edition and the Moto 360 and probably other devices for at least the past two months (I was directly told this by someone of 'Executive' status in the company).  But from all the other complaints I found on Moto forums, reddit and various other sites, it's apparent that this has been an ongoing issue for a while now but has become very problematic since January.  Coincidentally, it was announced in January 2016 that the name ""Motorola"" would no longer be used for the public, i.e. Lenovo is phasing out the brand names Moto and Motorola.

I have an in-warranty Moto G 3rd gen that started malfunctioning to the point of it being hit-or-miss if it will work.  Two months ago I was authorized for an Advanced exchange to get the device replaced. [The program says it takes a maximum of 4 business days + shipping time](https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63591/~/advance-exchange-program) for the replacement to arrive.  Weeks passed with no communication from Moto, I had to hound them over and over to find out what the status with my case and was and eventually found out they had no stock of Moto Gs for warranty exchange.  They tried to look for similar devices (The Moto X Pure Edition) and they were out of stock of that too.  And after some searching, the same is true for the Moto 360 as well.  Here are some quotes with their sources:  

* https://www.consumeraffairs.com/cell_phones/motorola.html - Read a few, skim the rest but no need to go beyond the first page.  You get the idea pretty quick.  
* [I sent in my black, metal band Moto 360 (1st gen) to Motorola over a month ago when it stopped powering on. They received it and I didn't get an update for 1 month so I called them and they said they are out of stock but they could offer me the champagne colored watch - I refused since I would've bought that color originally if it was what I wanted. Anyways, they said to wait 2 days to see if they get more in stock - I waited 11 days (I was very patient) and called today and they said they still don't have any in stock.](https://www.reddit.com/r/moto360/comments/3r76ik/motorola_not_honoring_warranty_because_they_are/)  
* [Three months after purchase, phone stopped working entirely (no water or physical damage). Sent it in and was promised to receive a new phone within 5 days. 10 days later, I called their support line to ask about the delay. They said it would take another 7-10 business days. Today, after an additional week, I called to inquire, and another rep told me it would arrive in two weeks. Worst service I have ever experienced. This is my third Motorola phone over five years, and after this experience, I will never buy a Motorola product again. Still waiting for my phone. 4/4/16](http://www.customerservicescoreboard.com/Motorola)  This link has a ton of other people reporting similar issues.  
* [Today (4/11/2016), I called the RE Team again to get an update, and happened to reach Marlin again. He had nothing to update me with because the status was still the same: there were no replacement phones available at the wharehouse. He apologized several times, and understood why I was upset. Then I asked him if replacement phones haven't been available for a month, and customers are out there waiting for a replacements, why not give them a new phone. **His response was that the team wants to do something like this, but Corporate has told them no discounts of any kind are to be offered and no new phones are to be offered.**](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Moto-X-Pure-Moto-X-Style/Moto-X-Pure-Repair-Replacement-Limbo/td-p/3305032)  Scroll through the rest of the [Moto X forums](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Moto-X-Pure-Moto-X-Style/bd-p/449) and check out the other device forums as well.  You'll see complaint after complaint of people waiting weeks/months for Moto to get stock of their particular device to fulfill their warranty exchange.  
* [During this entire span of about 1.5 months, I was forced to go buy a temporary phone. Not only that, but Motorola charged me the full price of the replacement since they haven't received the original defective phone. I've spent hours & hours on the phone and via email with support and they've been rude, forgettful and unaccomodating. In fact, this is by far the worst support experience I've had with any company in my lifetime. After looking through Better Business Bureau reviews, looks like I'm not the only one who has gone through this.  Any ideas on ways I can finally resolve this issue? I'm tempted just to bring my lawyer in or submit an inquiry to some consumer watchdog groups.  Thanks!](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Moto-X-Pure-Moto-X-Style/Help-Stuck-in-two-month-support-purgatory-amp-they-keep-sending/m-p/3306689#M12722)

There's a plethora of evidence out there showing Motorola's unwillingness to keep the legal promises made in their limited warranty.  If you need to use your warranty, be prepared to spend hours on the phone and weeks of waiting.  You can call them and speak to supervisors and get your case escalated but you'll only end up listening to same lines repeated over and over - ""sorry we're still out of stock all we can do is wait for stock then we'll ship your replacement"" (which will be a refurbished phone).  
 
Threatening legal action or contacting consumer advocacy groups seems to occasionally produce results from peoples' testimonials.  That or leveraging social media to your advantage.  

BTW I'm not writing this in the hope it will personally help me with my issue.  I'm writing this so Motorola device owner's will know that the 12 month limited warranty that came with their device is virtually meaningless.  And I'm hoping this post gains attention so more people are aware of Motorola's practices.  I'm not a lawyer, so I can't say if their practices and policies are illegal or not, (in my opinion immoral, but that doesn't mean anything) but from the research I did there are state and federal laws designed to protect the consumer and ensure the warranter honors the agreement.  

On the Federal level there is the [Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law) and the laws will vary state to state.  

So hopefully I got my point across.  This isn't a call to action.  This isn't a person complaining about their customer experience.  The primary purpose of this post is to serve as a warning to /r/Android (and any other sub I xpost to) of what to expect when dealing with Motorola's warranty service and to facilitate discussion about recent experiences with Motorola's warranty service, even if it's contrary to my experience and all my citations.  Are they intentionally doing this?  Is it just a shortage of inventory due to change in ownership and facilities?  What do people think?

And I must confess, I have a secondary purpose for writing this.  it is the small hope that this post will gain attention and affect some type of change. 

Thanks for reading.

Oh and here's the actual warranty:

this website,  please  contact Motorola using  the  contact  details  provided  on  the  customer support website at **[insert url]**.  

Gotta love that attention to detail in a legally binding document.

**Edit #1**: it's interesting how many of you are bringing up Lenovo and their reputation for having terrible customer support, especially when it comes to warranties and repairs. I actually had just as negative of an experience with Lenovo regarding a laptop, and as a result I will never spend another dollar with Lenovo.  The thing I find funny was that I had to send my laptop to Lenovo for repair in Fort Worth Texas. Well guess where Motorola's repair and warranty center is now? Fort Worth Texas.

 And not to get too personal, the laptop I received back was completely non-functional, as in if you had pressed the power button you would have seen it didn't even turn on.  And in my links above you will see plenty of people complaining about sending their phones to Fort Worth for repairs and getting non-functioning phones back.  

I recall one person talking about their Moto G no longer getting a signal, so he sent it there for repairs and when he got it back they had replaced the power button on the phone.

Capitalism is like democracy, you vote with your dollar. If you don't like the way a company does business then don't ""vote"" for them.

I only hope more do the same!  Thanks Paul K.  Maybe if a few news sites pick up on this and contact Motorola, we will actually see some change in their behavior.  If any more sites do an article on this, I'll add the links to the OP to keep people updated.  

Also thank you to everyone who posted their stories, I had no idea there were this many disenfranchised customers who have shared a similar experience to mine."

The answer is that it does not use any function of 360 Security app, but outsourcing only DB checking for unnecessary files.

Deletion logic is handled by Samsung's logic, and it is said that 360 DB is used to check the Junk File that can delete files.

Android,Why Apple doesn't care that a quarter of all iPhone users eventually switch to Android,
Android,Reminder: /r/Android makes up a tiny minority of enthusiasts Android phone users who don't represent the market at large,"You folks here are very saavy in terms of the tech in Android phones, their design, and their price points.  The point of this post isn't to disparage your opinions, but to remind you that at the end of the day: **this place is an echo-chamber made up of a small portion of the overall market**

It's a little tiring hearing the same crap after any phone launch:

* Notches
* Loss of features (headphone jacks, sd card slots, IR blasters, etc.)
* Bloatware by OEM
* SoC/RAM/Tech Specs

OEMs never catered to this crowd.  We're too demanding, we want the ""perfect"" phone, but every option is always a compromise in one way or the other between three main things:

* Tech Specs
* Design/Size
* Support/Software

Every designer is out there trying to differentiate themselves from the other OEMs.  Samsung does it through design and tech specs, but usually falls short on support over the life of the phone.  Google is all about the software and camera tech.  HTC is just there.  LG is all about specs and design, but also falls short on support.  

Average buyers don't usually watch keynotes, or read too many reviews, or spend hours watching a dude scratch a phone up to show its durability.  They'll get the phone that looks cool and is in their price range.  Hell, some folks don't even know what Android is... they view phones by their manufacturers instead.

So at the end of the day: **Relax**.  Chances are your expectations for a device are so far out of the norm that you're always going to be disappointed.  

Unpopular opinions:

* Pixel 3XL will likely outsell the smaller 3.  The notch will not be as bad as people make it out to be.  Even MKBHD admits this. 
* The Pixel 2XL screen debacle was only really a thing here... most real world users didn't care.
* Samsung is not the bloatware company it used to be.  Bixby is better than Google assistant at actually *using* phone features.
* Phones are always going to be priced at what the market can bear.  If the market cannot bear the price, then it will go down.  
* Addendum: if a phone is too expensive for you today, then wait a month or two and it will come down in price.  Galaxy S9's are cheaper today than they were at launch.
* Headphone jacks are never coming back

Lastly:

* If some company made the perfect ""/r/Android phone"" you'd all still find something to bitch about.

Cheers!"

The iPad Air is around the same age of a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (yeah, they were not even called Galaxy Tab back then).

This is why Fuchsia is needed now. Google can't pretend to build a successful platform for the future when it provides updates for half the life of its main competitor at best. These devices are expensive. Galaxy Tabs are similarly priced than comparable iPads, and so are flagship Android phones, yet iPhones get much more support. Even Surfaces from the same year still receive the latest version of the OS. I know this has been discussed before, but just because nobody does anything doesn't mean we should stop complaining.

**I know this breaks a few rules but I feel like this is too important not to break them.**

*************

## What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

## What's the plan?

On June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*.

## What can you do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/)\- and sign your username in support to this post.
2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord.
3. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible., and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love."

""Android device makers, like Samsung, have included fingerprint unlocking technology in buttons on the sides of their phones for years""

It's kinda unfortunate that Samsung got mentioned first but it was Sony who popularized the side-mounted fingerprint reader in [2015](https://www.androidcentral.com/setting-and-using-fingerprint-scanner-sony-xperia-z5)! Now, Xiaomi, Motorola and others are utilizing the side mounted fp readers in their new phones. 

Some of the popular features that we take for granted in Android has been introduced/popularized by Sony like IP-water resistance (as [early as 2013 in Xperia Z](https://techland.time.com/2013/07/10/sony-xperia-z-review/) , extra-tall displays, Stamina mode for battery longevity, 960fps recording etc.. Also, Sony has contributed so much to the Android AOSP and features such as[ Android theming](https://www.androidcentral.com/waiting-dawn-new-android-theming-era)  and [high res Bluetooth audio ](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/15004562/sony-google-android-o-ldac-wireless-music) was borne out of Sony's contributions. 

Hopefully, more Android makers will adopt Sony's [charge and play](https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-gaming-feature-charge-and-play-without-degrading-battery-health-h-s-power-control/amp/) battery mode, as it will help the battery.

Sony phones are so underrated.

EDIT: They also introduced/popularized the ff:

* 4K HDR recording in XZ2 in 2018

* 4K HDR 120FPS recording in Xperia 5 II

* NFC [tags](https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/sony-mobile/114030-sony-xperia-s-nfc-smarttags) in 2012"

Android,Difference in the smartphone culture in India and the US.,"Ok, so in the last few months where I have been browsing through this subreddit a lot, I have noticed some very clear differences in how people in my country (India) and people in US use/need features and, overall, their Android. I find these differences fascinating. English isn't my first language, so sorry for the mistakes. Also, I may be wrong in my assumptions, so feel free to correct me and explain :) 


First off, preferred phone size. People here, and in China too I guess, love huge phones. 5.5"" is pretty common, with 6"" phones also selling very well, though some people like me prefer 5"". But anything smaller than that is considered 'tiny'. Whereas I have seen many westerners here constantly asking for 4.5"" phones, for ease of use. Do people in the US watch movies on their phones? Do they have smaller hands? Also, are smaller phones only a requirement of a few redditors, or is this a common thing among the Android users? Please note that I'm asking these questions out of pure curiosity. 


Second, sms usage. I have seen this discussion quite a lot of times, especially along the lines of Allo-Whatsapp-iMessage. Sms is something we don't actively use for personal communication anymore. Its just there for notifications from banks, getting OTPs, and such. We use primarily Whatsapp and FB Messenger for communication here. Sms fallback (like iMesaage) is not something we want because sms is quite expensive here, and frankly, we just don't use sms much anymore. I think i understand this difference pretty well, but explanation about something I might have missed is welcome. 


Third, budget tier smartphones. Maybe its just reddit, but I get the impression that flagship phones are the most popular ones in the US. India is a huge market for budget smartphones because, lets face it, India is indeed an economically backward country. But the budget section I'm talking about is the sub-15k (around $230), with phones like Redmi 3S, Redmi Note 3, Lenovo Vibe K5 and its Note version, Samsung Galaxy J3, J5, J7, and not about OP3T and similarly priced phones. 20k+ (around $310) are not considered budget here, they are considered expensive. As for the Pixel, I have yet to see a Pixel XL here. So it's not popular at all. How much is that section popular in western countries? I have heard a few things about BLU smartphones. 


Fourth, dual sims. In India, dual sim is a must have feature for most people, students and professionals alike. I myself have two phones, both dual sims. So I have actually four numbers. This is fairly common. If a phone is not dual sim, it won't sell much. Whereas from some comments on Reddit I have seen in passing, I think dual sim is not really a common trend in the US. People still carry two phones with one sim each, one for professional and other for personal use. Why is it so? What are the contributing factors?

Edit : Since a lot of people are asking why I need four sims, let me clarify. I actually don't need 4,I'm keeping two extra just because I can and there is negligible maintenance cost involved. I (and most Indians) use prepaid. We 'reacharge' our numbers with, let's say, 100 rupees, and it gives me around 90 credits. Now I can use this credit to buy data, specific plans with limited validity, or I can just use it to call with the default call rates applying. Or I can just leave it be, and it'd remain there for months, sometimes years. 
Also, I chose 100 rupees as an example. I can also use 10 rupees' recharge. 1$ is around 60-65 Indian rupees. So with 1$, I'm set for months, or even years. 
 Now why I and several other people here use two sims. Without any extra expenditure. And since data packs and calling packs are seperate, the bill actually gets lower. For example, Telenor's call rates are dirt cheap, but its data speed is bad. On the other hand, Airtel has good data speeds, but its call rate is way more than Telenor's. So many people use Telenor for calling and Airtel for data, getting the best of both without shelling out double the money. 


Sorry for the wall of text :p


Tl;dr: lets discuss the differences in how Indians (easterners?) and Americans (westerners) use/need features in their smartphones."

Android,Android is the only thing stopping Samsung from achieving Apple like control,"Samsung make everything. Their hardware, pretty much *every* component Samsung can create. From memory chips, displays and CPUs, Samsung can make a phone without outsourcing anything. Even Apple can't do this - their components are made by other companies.

Not only that, but they've gotten good at it. The Exynos CPU series is competitive, they have a near monopoly over the OLED market because their screens are downright awesome. They can make a phone from the bottom up, without help (yes ik demand and stuff requires outsourcing, that's not the point).

The only thing they cannot do themselves is the software. They rely on Android and it's clear they don't like it as they seem to be distancing themselves from Google as much as possible. See: Android wear, GApps competition apps, Bixby. Samsung don't have a replacement for Android. Tizen is not made by Samsung and it's pretty bad, the security and ecosystem is crap. So until Samsung make their own mobile OS, they can't get total hardware and software control like Apple. They're very close though.

Thoughts?

""I think we knew this was coming. All flagships are adopting this type of  feature. The question is whether it's implemented well. I don't want a  night to day mode like on the P3. Which was basically turning even the  darkest shot into the brightest shot, with orange/yellowish tint. I want  something more like Mate20Pros where it takes an actual darker shot,  makes it clearer and obtain better detail. Yes it's impressive software  regardless, but I think a night mode shouldn't try to make a image super  bright. It should capture better detail in otherwise darker shots where  you'd normally lose the detail.""

""There is absolutely no way these are the legit prices for their phones.

**EDIT:**

I just noticed at 1:19 he stole my same comment from yesterday about my prediction for the real prices on the S10 models. Lol.

**EDIT 2:**

Those that pointed this out in the comment section on his video, I appreciate it!

**EDIT 3:**

His email is in his about section on YouTube for ""business enquiries"", in case he decides he will start buying comments instead. You guys can maybe pitch him something and sell him your comments!

**EDIT 4:**

Damage control. He deleted the older video, and a lot of comments have been deleted calling him out.

**EDIT 5:**

Sal has commented on one of the comments I left in the video addressing it and has apologized to me. Seems this effected his channel in some way. Not sure how I feel about it, but while most in my opinion would ignore the issue entirely, he at least apologized for it. A video apology would of been better or if he didn't partake in damage control, but I'll take it . I'd like to point out I originally found this to be funny, but at the same time believed it needed exposure as I feel it's an on going issue. Hopefully this encourages Sal and other channels to push out more original content or to at least credit sources.

**EDIT 6:**

Sal has Opted to delete the newest video/comments as well for further damage control, taking back his public apology considering when it was said. I feared he would do this and was actually thinking he'd do the right thing. Sal we know you will still be seeing this post so I want to say to you, not cool Sal. Not cool. Also continuing to delete comments on your videos, and blocking people on twitter is not helping the situation. People are now gonna know your channel is more full of shit than ever.

**TechTalkTv**, I now know you're only sorry because you got caught.

**EDIT 7:**

Sal is denying this was damage control and spinning it as he deleted it because he was receiving racist comments, some others in his comments section were saying people were saying racist things as well ( I can't say what happened during the time of 3am-11am, but before and after I saw no such racist comments, not giving him the benefit of the doubt considering he was deleting comments immediately, and thereafter). As someone who has monitored his channel comments and this subs comments, I saw no such comments and at this point he's spinning his own wheels and playing victim. Sal, we know why you were deleting comments, we know why you blocked followers on twitter, we know why you deleted the videos, and we know why your apology is meaningless given the time it was said, and where it was said.

**EDIT 8:**

This is purely just speculation, but their was a person commenting in the comments section on TechTalkTv's channel with the name ""S R"" defending Sal, and I think one of the only 2-3 people defending him also using the talking point that people were saying racist things. I called him out on it and asked him when was their a racist comment, and he deflected then deleted all his comments. Note: He only deleted his comments after I had immediately said his channel was sketchy. To me this is pretty suspect, that he would use the same talking point as Sal, and then delete the comments after he was called out on it. If I didn't know any better, I'd say Sal made separate channels to rush to his defense and pretend to be someone else. But again this is just speculation.

Android,Oppo outright confirmed to us that their 40W degrades to 70% capacity in the same cycles 15W would to 90%. It's all a crock of shit marketing race seeking to have the bigger numbers.,
Android,So let's nip this f/1.6 marketing thing right in the bud while it's just starting,"This is mostly a marketing move, just like sensor size was with other phones like the N6P and Pixel. Neither of those parameters by themselves determine how much light the system gathers. f/1.6 doesn't do any good if the sensor size is smaller, which the V30's is.

No one in their right mind would state that the V30 with f/1.6 has lower noise than a DLSR at, say, f/2 or f/4, and that is obvious to most of us. But why exactly is that? f/number is determined by focal length divided by entrance pupil diameter. For example, to get a similar angle of view to the Pixel camera, a ""full frame"" DSLR would [need](http://www.anandtech.com/show/10753/the-google-pixel-xl-review/4) a 26mm lens. If you set the f/number to f/2, the entrance pupil will be 13mm. This is why the Pixel, with the same f/2 number, does not gather the same amount of light than that DSLR. In fact, the Pixel's entrance pupil is about 2.34mm only. Very small sensors require just very short focal lengths. Sometimes phone and compact camera manufacturers advertise a focal length that's ""equivalent"" to a standard ""full frame"" camera lens but the real focal length of the Pixel's lens, for instance, is only 4.67mm.

I can't think of a better real-world example than the Pixel and the S7. The former advertised a bigger sensor which was true, but can't beat the S7 in noise performance in raw images. The S7 advertised a ""wide"" f/1.7 aperture, but can't unambiguously beat the Pixel either. They both produce about the same amount of noise at equivalent exposure settings (targeting for same shutter speed), and this is because their entrance pupils are not that different in size (2.47mm for S7 vs. 2.34 mm for Pixel). The Pixel has a higher f/number, and the S7 has a smaller sensor, and both basically cancel out their advantages of sensor size and low f/number respectively. Now, if they Pixel had the same f/1.7 number, then the bigger sensor size would have actually mattered. Vice versa for the S7.

See the samples from RAW in [this article](http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#A_note_on_pixel_size_sensor_size_and_aperture).

This is a big part of the reason the V30's camera doesn't impress. Another part is the camera app like others have pointed out. Google has the right idea, with these tiny camera systems you can only go so far. Much better gains are to be made by applying clever computational photography, and that's exactly what HDR+ is, and why the Pixel's (jpeg) results are so well regarded, cause the raws are nothing special compared to competition like the S7. Microsoft is also [investing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/microsoftpix/) on it. My Sony RX10M3 also has a noise reduction similar to HDR+ but not as sophisticated. This is where manufacturers should be investing most of their camera research IMO. It's the only feature that has actually yielded significant results in the real world. f/number (V30), sensor size (Pixel), and pixel size (HTC Ultra Pixel) as marketing bullet points, cannot claim that.

Android,I really don’t understand the excuses manufacturers make for taking out the headphone jack,"Google said it was taken out to make way for a bezel less future. But wheres the proof of it? The Pixel 2 has the same ugly bezels that the pixel 1 had. The Pixel 2 XL has a somewhat better screen but it still doesn’t feel like a proper excuse to remove the jack as there are still huge bezels on BOTH sides. Should they should have kept the jack on the Pixel 2 and removed it from the XL?

Apple says its to ease waterproofing and they simply didn’t have enough space. Yet they only achieved IP67 instead of IP68. But a guy on youtube proved its somewhat possible.

Again what I want to point out is competition has proven all this wrong. I'm no Samsung fanboy but it can be clearly seen that Samsung has the finest design out there. MicroSD, IP68, Headphone Jack, and a great infinity screen. They even curved the screen at the sides! So isn’t whatever excuse google and apple make invalid? Cause Samsung has already proven them all wrong way back in 2017 March. 

What I feel like is manufacturers are making lazy excuses to just cut off the headphone jack so they don’t have to spend much time in making it work. This is what I love about Samsung is they go all out, no compromises. Wireless charging to headphone jack they load their shit with everything they can find."

Android,Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Display Issue - The scam that Samsung doesn't want to admit,"I know Samsung for the great phones and the software support they provide. All was well until the March Security update for Galaxy Note 9. Then, a lot of the devices displays started breaking. Displays overheated, and started turning green/yellowish green. 

Obviously, a lot of users started complaining regarding this. After all, an issue due to a software update can be fixed by software, right? Apparently not, because sending the logs to their team through the internal bug reporting app led to no answers but generic ones like ""Reset your device"". Obviously, resetting the device did not work.

This is similar to the display issues plaguing the new Samsung phones like Galaxy S20, but which cannot be fixed by a software update.

Unfortunately, Samsung still does not admit the fault is due to the update, even though this problem is reported by hundreds of users across the world. While trying to find a fix for this problem (when I thought it could be fixed by a software update), I managed to find a telegram group: (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

Looking through the messages, I found that Samsung asked the users to get their display replaced by paying for it which costs nearly 1/3rd of the price of the phone. Not to mention the Note 9 is a ""premium"" line of phones marketed by Samsung, and has not even completed 2 years from its launch. For a ""premium phone"", one would expect the device to last 2 years at the very least, even though the warranty covers 1 year. Not all of the users will buy the phone at launch, so most of the users are now out of warranty -- and the display is broken. 

And Samsung is deliberately trying to suppress the issue (possibly to prevent bad publicity during the impending launch of their new phones). When I tweeted to them about the problems that I was facing, Samsung support asked me to DM. When I refused, because the problem needed to be public, they just spit out the link to find a nearest service centre. And then they deleted those tweets. I have had no response since.

2 days ago, when the phone became progressively unusable, I decided to submit the same to the Service Centre. I then get a call saying Samsung has released an internal guideline to all the Service Centres to fix the phones having the issue under warranty, but only if the body is free of any dents. When I asked the technicians to share the document, they refused saying that it's an internal document. This confirms that Samsung knows about the issue, but is deliberately denying users a fix in order to prevent bad publicity. Moreover, asking to fix only the phones without any dents disqualifies most phone owners. Samsung is basically telling the users -- ""We will fix the phones only if they are as good as new"" -- for a phone which customers have bought since 2 years ago.

More details are available in the telegram group:  (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

Android,Everything I learned about Nexus at the NYC Nexus Open Studio Event,"I was able to drop by [Google’s Nexus Open Studio Event in New York City](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3w34pc/google_is_running_an_open_nexus_event_in_nyc/) and it was a terrific, intimate event. There were neat little [Android Experiments](https://www.androidexperiments.com/), [demos, sticker printers](https://twitter.com/search?q=Nexusstudio), [and sample devices](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/nexusstudio/). And even better, there were representatives from seemingly all of the disciplines at Google involved with the new Nexus phones: Android UX design, software product managers for Nexus, Nexus industrial design, Nexus hardware engineering, and others. And they were all super friendly and surprisingly open to answering all kinds of questions, from the mundane to controversial. In the end, whether or not we might agree or disagree with their product and design decisions, I came away with a clear picture of how passionate and thoughtful the folks at Google are. 

Apologies for the dreadfully long post, but I wanted to share some of my experiences and the really interesting things I learned chatting with the Google staff about Nexus, Android, and technology.

Before diving in, I just want to caveat here that these are merely my recollections (sorted by theme and not chronology) and were the product of casual conversations with lots of Google folks. So, each answer is often a mix of multiple people's perspectives, including my own. Please don't take this information as gospel and please forgive me if there are some inaccuracies or misinterpretations. Also any ""quotes"" I've included are for effect and are my best attempt to remember some of the really impactful or interesting tidbits I learned; I tried to honestly paraphrase and should not be read as verbatim quotes.

**tl;dr: The Nexus Open Studio event was fantastic. Many people from the Nexus and Android teams were there and were incredibly friendly and open to engaging conversation. If you love learning about the small stories on Android/Nexus development and Google, there is some really awesome stuff below like answers to the Nexus 6P display generation and more.**

----------

# ...On the development/design timeline of the Nexus 5X/6P:

I learned that the design and development of a smartphone typically takes around two years. For the Nexus 5X and 6P?  ....a grueling **seven** months.

# ...On the industrial design of the Nexus 5X:

A lot of work went into the curvature and radius of the edges of the 5X and the camera ""hump"". The industrial designers ensured that each of the Nexus 5X's curves utilized ""C3"" continuous surfacing. It's a lot of work for a small detail, but offers significant rewards in terms of light play around the surface and how naturally/organically the surface curves. (I admit this is all I was able to understand!)

# ...On the engineering challenges to nail the industrial design of the Nexus 6P:

I had personally naively assumed that since Nexus phones tended to be based off hardware designs of existing phones (the Nexus 4 and LG Optimus G, the Nexus 5 and the LG G2, etc.) that Google would be merely using established, solved industrial design processes that were well known by the manufacturing partner. It was interesting to find out that a lot of experimentation and testing still went into things like the bead blasting process and the diamond-cut chamfer.

I had imagined that much like going to a paint store and picking from a huge wall of swatches, that the colors and finishes were a known and well-established thing for a manufacturing partner—they just merely needed to be selected. However, even something like the media used in the bead blasting process still needed constant testing and refinement. The Nexus engineers and designers tried a variety of media like coconut shells, glass beads—

> *""We spent lots of time over in China pulling samples fresh off the bead blasting manufacturing line, running over to a window, and scrutinizing the way the light played off the surface.""*

All told, there were around 80 different manufacturing steps for the Nexus 6P (and fun fact: Google dictated that all of the aluminum leftovers in manufacturing were to be collected and reused/recycled). In fact, the circumferential chamfer that wraps around the visor is actually an industry first, using a brand-new process. In addition there were other major challenges in terms of managing the RF with an all metal phone—making sure antennas weren't detuned by the aluminium body through careful injection molding processes. 

# ...On the relationship between the Nexus manufacturing partner and Google:

I was surprised to learn that the manufacturing partner relationship can be a mixed bag and even depends on the partner (see next topic). Even with the latest Nexus 5X and 6P where Google exercised a considerable amount of design influence, there was a give and take between the manufacturing partner and Google. Oftentimes there was pushback from the partner for the sake engineering or manufacturing convenience—one designer mentioned that it was three-months of back and forth *just* to get the USB Type-C connector centered on the bottom of the 6P. Another had referred to the bottom of the recently announced HTC A9 as evidence of design by cost and engineering convenience. He was sympathetic though, as he recognized that for many of Google's OEM partners, the teams live and die by the success (or lack thereof) of a single product launch, and so cost (in both design and manufacturing) is a legitimate consideration. Google, however, can afford to take a longer view on cost and invest in trying to hit a higher bar of design. 

The relationship was a lot of work (one Google engineer spent about two of the seven month development time over in China overseeing things), but it seems like both the [manufacturing partners](http://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-exec-nexus-6p-dream-also-challenging-one?utm_source=ac&utm_medium=dlvrit) and Nexus engineers and designers were really happy with the end result.

# ...On the Nexus family design language and the Motorola Nexus 6:

Following up on this, I asked about the Nexus 6 and the manufacturing partner selected for that generation, Motorola. Its design seemed to share more with other phones in the Motorola family than it did with any other device in the Nexus family. 

> *""...Somebody backed out at the last minute.""*

I didn't poke any further, but it was added that as a manufacturing partner, Motorola exercised tighter control over the design and engineering of the phone, in a way vastly different from other Nexus partners. It sounded like Google designers and engineers (obviously) preferred the more Google-directed partnership, so this may be the last we see of a Nexus 6-ish device with a design that deviates so much from the Nexus family language. (And you all can read between the lines there.)

# ...On the lessons learned from the Nexus 6:

The team there recognized and acknowledged a lot of the complaints/problems of the Nexus 6. It was too big, too bulky, hard to use one handed, and worst of all—

> *""...the Nexus 6 spun around when you tried to use it on a table.""*

Along with the fact that the Nexus 5 was Google's best selling Nexus phone, this seemed to set the stage for what we see with the Nexus 5X and 6P today. First, a return to the tried-and-true formula of the Nexus 5, but with updated hardware and a modernized design for 2015. 

On the Nexus 6P, there were obviously more design changes. For one thing, the screen shrinkage from 6"" to 5.7"" seems small, but vastly improved one-handed use. Also, they were proud that they were able to fit a 5.7"" size screen into a device with the same phone size as competitors with a smaller 5.5"" screen (clearly a reference to the iPhone 6 Plus). In addition, the visor was a key design component addition. For one thing, an all-metal frame did need RF windows for sensors, cellular reception, etc. But moreover, the full-width visor allowed for a stable base... and no more spinning phones on tables. 😄

# ...On the just-barely ""off center"" placement of the camera module in the Nexus 6P visor:

I really enjoyed this particular story of the design and engineering hurdles with the Nexus 6P: Astute owners of the Nexus 6P might notice that the [camera lens is just-oh-so-slightly above the center axis of the oval camera ""surround""](http://forums.androidcentral.com/attachments/nexus-6p/202819d1445644158t-nexus-6p-build-quality-rear-glass-visor-gap-google-nexus-6p-review-camera.jpg) it sits within. Well, it turns out it wasn't just some design oversight.

Thanks to the all-aluminum design of the Nexus 6P, all of the RF (wireless) ""stuff"" and sensors needs to fit within either the visor or the bottom plastic RF ""windows"". This includes the [NFC sensor](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/ZlpUoq3OjhHJsqTo.huge), which was even of a special design that allowed for a small part of the sensor to sit ""above the fold"" in the RF window, while the rest was below (check out the teardown photo and you'll see). 

When it came to QC test the NFC sensor in the Nexus 6P's first iteration... **it failed**. Not enough of the sensor had been exposed in the visor, and they had to painfully widen the visor just a little. Well, the camera had originally been symmetrically aligned in the visor, but when they widened it, the camera was now off center (and unable to be moved around anymore because of design and timing limitations). To help conceal the now slightly-off center nature of the camera within the visor, the design team threw in the oval camera surround.

# ...On bucking the trend of thinner phones with smaller batteries:

When discussing the Nexus 6P ""visor hump"", I mentioned that one of the frequent suggestions I've seen in terms of eliminating humps altogether was to just maintain thickness on a phone and use the added volume for more battery capacity. The engineer just shrugged and replied:

> *""Apple really sets the bar on thinness there.""*

# ...On the Nexus 6P and 5X placement of the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor:

The Nexus design team considered and spent a lot of time researching three different fingerprint sensor locations before settling on the rear placement we know today: the bottom front (e.g., Samsung/iPhone), the side power button (e.g., Sony Xperia), and the center rear. Designers liked the discoverability and accessibility of the Samsung/iPhone model, but felt that the bottom edge placement placed all the weight of the phone aft of the sensor and there was a cantilevering effect that was both awkward and increased the risk of dropping. The side positioning had limitations based upon the thinness of the phone and those limitations would reduce the surface area available to read a fingerprint. The backside approach allowed for a large surface area to capture a fingerprint, was where the index finger naturally fell, and also was suitable for both right and left-handed users. 

> *""As you scale the phone, the fingerprint sensor does not move—because it's not based on [the size of] the phone, it's based on the human hand.""*

The backside sensor approach also had the benefit of being scalable and independent of phone size, which was particularly relevant for the two-sized Nexus launch. It was pointed out that the fingerprint sensor was in an almost identical location on both the Nexus 5X and 6P, despite the differences in the size of the phones. The hardware engineer conceded that the industrial designers were so passionate about perfecting the fingerprint sensor location that...

> *""In fact, [the industrial designers] were so adamant about basing this on the human hand [we had to compromise on the battery size](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/ZlpUoq3OjhHJsqTo.huge), to make sure he got his way—**to make sure it fit the human hand.**""*

# ...On how Google tested and benchmarked the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor:

Google wanted a quantitative way to measure the speed of the fingerprint sensor while they were optimizing its speed. So, Google engineers built a rig with a robot ""hand"" and highspeed camera for testing and benchmarking the fingerprint sensor. However, the missing link was what to use for the actual fleshy finger stand-in. 

> *""The product manager for fingerprint... she was having lunch one day in the cafe and she was having chicken drumsticks. And she realized that the skin of the chicken drumstick is really similar to the human hand. So she took a batch of chicken drumsticks, took it upstairs to the lab, washed it, picked off a bit and tied it to the robot, and used that to measure the latency of the fingerprint sensor.""*

# ...On sourcing the new Sony camera module:

The camera was clearly the major highlight of the event (other than the Nexus Imprint, both of which had key presentations), and many of the team I spoke with were incredibly proud of it. One product manager proudly noted that the sensor sourced was an industry-first and that it was pulled from Sony's digital camera parts bin (and not mobile camera menu).

One of the things I learned from the team was that picking out a sensor is not merely just the picking of a sensor from a parts menu. In every implementation, Sony needs to attach a team to support the integration of the camera sensor. Sony was initially concerned that the sales volumes wouldn't be sufficient on the Nexus phones to be worth the investment for Google to reach so deep into their premium parts menu. It took a lot of convincing to get Sony onboard to provide Google this particular camera module. Thankfully it turns out Sony was really satisfied about the press and acclaim it received in connection with the new Nexus phones and their stellar camera.

# ...On the absence of camera OIS:

Sony did not offer this particular camera module with an OIS option.

# ...On the Nexus 6P display, and whether it is a “current generation” Samsung AMOLED display:

> *“...The Nexus 6P actually uses the same display panel as the Note 5”*

Knowing that this is a hot topic on /r/android, I brought up the fact that testing has shown that on the Nexus 6P, its display has a lower maximum brightness and higher display power consumption than seen on the Note 5—key indicators of the AMOLED panel generation—I received knowing acknowledgement. So it turns out that the display panel is the same, but that much like the practice of CPU/SoC binning, there is variation inherent in AMOLED panel fabrication. Here, Google was able to procure the lower binned, yet current-generation displays from Samsung for the Nexus 6P. 

# ...On the thermals of the Snapdragon 810 SoC:

The thermals of the Snapdragon 810 were known to Google and were of some concern. Qualcomm attached a team of engineers to help control thermals and supplied Google with a *third* version of the Snapdragon 810 (which when I got home, seems to match public, well-established reports that the Nexus 6P uses the v2.1 version of the 810).

# ...On the removal of wireless charging from the Nexus 5X and 6P:

It sounded like the intention to go with a never-been-done-before-on-Nexus all-aluminum design had a big role to play. The Qi wireless charging was not going to work on the metal back, and so it needed to be dropped. For the Nexus 5X, even though it had a plastic design, the product team consciously wanted to maintain a certain feature parity/consistency between the two models (like in the same way they kept the same camera, flash, IR sensor, etc.) Furthermore, the reduced pain point of the universal direction USB Type C connector added onto the decision to drop wireless Qi charging.

# ...On the Nexus 6P""Bendgate"" controversy:

All of the Nexus phones go through rigorous strength and wear testing. When the videos first broke out about the ""Nexus 6P Bendgate"", the engineers rushed back into the labs to double-check and rerun the tests to make sure they hadn't missed anything. The engineer I spoke with indicated that nearly all phones are strength tested to similar specifications and all have their first ""bend"" at a similar weight pressure—he quoted the iPhone 6 Plus and Nexus 6P to be around 40-45 kgs on the particular bending bench. Apparently, where phones vary is the ultimate failure strength (the amount of pressure for the phone to catastrophically fail after a first bend), but the pressure-to-first-bend was apparently consistent across most phones.

# ...On the ""twist to launch"" camera action that was apparently pulled from the Nexus 6P:

According to one product manager I spoke to about this, the feature didn't test well and was never formally implemented as opposed to being dropped/pulled. It was an accident it was included on websites.

# ...On controversial topics like internal storage and integrated batteries:

I asked some of the product managers what they thought about the controversies over internal storage and integrated batteries—particularly whether there was any truth to the theories that the limited internal storage was really an initiative to push users to cloud storage or that integrated batteries were there for planned obsolescence. 

The product managers were quite genuine and adamant that there were no ulterior motives and that things really boiled down to usability and design tradeoffs. On the internal storage side, they noted that this was an interesting and complex issue, and first pointed out that when they balance tradeoffs for a feature like expandable microSD storage, the same balance isn't made the same way for every market. For example, on Android One phones, the usability issues with microSD was outweighed by the need for price sensitivity and the greater challenges of single-up-front payment—and this use case is reflected in the inclusion of microSD in Android One designs and in Marshmallow's stronger adoption of external storage. 

However, on the Nexus side, the usability issues with microSD won the day. The product managers were concerned about things like slower, poorer quality microSD cards and microSD failure that were challenging for users to self-diagnose when there were multiple kinds of storage. A single, high quality internal storage solved this issue (at the cost of expandability). They also noted that in addition to considering users, a single unified storage was easier and more predictable for developers—a single fast and reliable internal storage meant better predictability on app performance, less problems with defining where to put files, and reduced troubleshooting/customer service.

We didn't get into the battery question as much, but the product managers noted that they really cared about the products they build. If they could have it their way, their phones would be timeless in a way similar to ""like a Gucci bag,"" with great longevity and resale value evidencing the quality of their product. So they too are disappointed with the inherent problems of lithium ion batteries. That said, the design benefits to an integrated battery were so great that the balance of tradeoffs really went in favor of non-removable batteries.

Anyway, as a personal aside, I know these are really hot button topics on /r/android and for those folks that firmly sit on one side of the fence or the other, I'm not entirely sure any justification or rationale can be said that would be truly satisfying. I still hope this shed some additional light on the topic though!

# ...On feedback on the Nexus products and Android UI:

Everyone I spoke with was really open to hearing about feedback and even criticism. Many of them even browse /r/android and are well aware of the passionate ""feedback"" that users voice here. 😄 Some noted that they definitely have heard the requests for a smaller, more premium phone instead of the premium 6P phablet and economical 5X phone. They said they are always looking into the decisions around this and are always rethinking those decisions for the next generation.

Another noted that in addition to the outside user feedback, they hear a lot of the same sentiment directly after the launch of a new feature or device. The engineers, designers, and other Googlers are a very vocal and strongly opinionated group and are frequently dogfooding and using their own products. 

I asked one of the UX designers what one of the most controversial things was that she had worked on—she confessed that she worked on and helped to implement the [bolded hour digit in the Jelly Bean clock app](http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/nexusae0_155.png). ...She noted with a smile that the reaction of Google staff on this change alone was swift and unequivocal.

# ...On the functionality and evolution of Android volume control:

A presentation was devoted to the user experience design and evolution of Android volume control from pre-Lollipop, to Lollipop, to Marshmallow and I also had an opportunity to chat with the UX designer on this. It would take too long to fully discuss each of the design decisions and cases they considered, but it was really neat to see the amount of user testing that went into this. I also gained a stronger appreciation of the challenges with something as superficially simple and innocent as ""volume control""—there are a serious amount of different permutations and use cases of alarms and volume control. 

These challenges were compounded by the fact that unlike many of Google's apps that are now decoupled from the OS and are updated routinely on the Play Store, volume control is still tightly woven into the OS. The UX team needs to finalize their decisions well before the launch of the OS and only has an annual window for which to make changes. 

# ...On the sale of Motorola to Lenovo:

Google's OEM partners were really concerned that despite the firewalls between the two organizations, that there was too much threat that a Google-Motorola would turn into a fully vertical entity like Apple (or Microsoft today with its Surface tablets), squeezing out its partners in the Android ecosystem. When I asked why the OEM partners were okay with the Nexus program, it sounded like the Nexus sales were still quite relatively small compared to the bigger OEM players (Samsung, LG, etc.) and were not threatening. 

# ...On the Nexus 6P three-microphone noise cancellation:

I thought I had seen on the [iFixit teardown](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nexus+6P+Teardown/51660) that two of the advertised “3 microphones (2 front, 1 rear) with noise cancellation” were located within each of the front-facing speaker grills, but wasn't sure given the risks of interference from the speakers. It turns out the microphones are in fact in the speaker grills, and that they can be spaced in a way that minimizes interference from the speakers.

# ...On the rumors of the next iPhone to pull the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of the Lightning connector:

> *""If anyone can do it, it's Apple and Beats.""*

The engineer noted that we've been stuck with the same form factor and technology on the 3.5mm analog jack for decades and figuring out the placement of it is a consistent design challenge and design limitation. There are a lot of new design opportunities afforded by moving to a new connector and opportunities around digital audio output (headphones with audiophile DACs and amps instead of relying on those in your phone!) and although Google doesn't really have the leverage to initiate a change like this, Apple definitely does—especially through its ownership of Beats.

# ...On knowing the name of the next Android version:

The dessert naming decision of the next version of Android is not known to most Googlers, even those in the Android UX design team. So they are as surprised as everyone else when the statue is finally unveiled. 

However, while they don't often know the what the *right* choice will be for a name, they often know what it *won't be*, so internal and code references to wordy names like ""Lemon Meringue Pie"" were placed with tongues firmly in cheeks. The team at Google also had a lot of fun when David Burke trolled the community with his [infamous ""milkshake"" watch stunt](http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/05/28/io-2015-dave-burke-wears-android-wear-watch-with-a-picture-of-a-milkshake-on-it-during-io-presentation-internet-freaks-out/)."

Android,[TIPS] Getting the best out of Android,"I have compiled a set of tweaks that I have done over time to get the best out of my Android. This includes getting rid of ads, reducing bloatware, focusing on privacy, getting more performance and battery life. Most of this are focused on non-rooted phones, there are better alternatives if you are rooted.

 Feel free to add your own tips below and I will add them here. 

1. **Debloating:** Many OEMs will have a lot of apps preloaded like Facebook, Microsoft, Google apps, and their own apps. These can be removed through ADB. This is safe and can be reinstalled easily if needed.  
Enable developer options by clicking the build number seven times and enable USB Debugging. Install ADB on your PC, connect your phone to PC and run **adb shell pm list packages** to list all your packages.   
To remove a package run **adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 <package\_name>.** You can find a list of bloatware list for your device / OEM from xda-developers (Eg. [Note 10 bloatware list](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-10/how-to/galaxy-note-10-note-10-plus-debloat-t3964225))


2. **Privacy:** 
   1. **App permissions:** App permissions are bundled under a single category now under Android-10. Permissions can be removed for apps that don't need them. Or better, removing permissions can be automated with [**Bouncer**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission&hl=en_IN) 
   2. More privacy options can be found in settings / app-settings through which you can turn off personalized ads.
   3. **Disposable email-ids:** Temporary email addresses can be created with apps like [**Temp Mail**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tempmail&hl=en_IN) if an app or website forces you to login.
   4. Use password managers and two factor authentications ([**Bitwarden**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&hl=en_IN) and [**andOTP**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp&hl=en_IN)) for secure logins.
   5. Prefer open-source alternatives instead of apps that collect your personal data.
   6. **Firewall:** I recommend [**Netguard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&hl=en_IN)**.** This blocks Internet access to apps that can function without internet (like Calculator, Camera, Gallery, Video / Music players). Netguard can also block ads and trackers (see below).


3. **Ad-blocking:** Before getting into this, I'd suggest buying a pro-version or supporting the developer directly whenever possible.
   1. There are ad-blocking apps like [**Blokada**](https://blokada.org/index.html) **/** [**DNS66**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/) that uses VPN to block ads system-wide. There are many hosts file around internet that can block Ads, Trackers, etc.
   2. If you are using [**Netguard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&hl=en_IN)**,** from above, there is a github version of it that supports ad-blocking as well ([https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md))
   3. If you prefer to do this without VPN, devices above Android-9 supports Private DNS in settings. (Having [dns.adguard.com](https://dns.adguard.com) as your private DNS will block ads system-wide)


4. **Performance and battery:**
   1. Frequently clearing an app from Recents menu will make it load again and consume more battery.
   2. Automation apps like Bixby Routines / Tasker can be used to enhance battery life / performance, like
      1. Turn off Mobile Data / Location when you're connected to Home Wifi network.
      2. Turn off Data-Sync when phone is not charging.
      3. Turn on Battery saver at night.
      4. Turn on Locations only when you open an app that needs it (like Google maps, Uber, etc.)
   3. Turning off background Wifi Scanning, Automatically download software updates can improve Battery life.
   4. Turn off Digital Wellbeing by removing it from Usage Data Access, if you're not using it.
   5. Don't use aggressive battery savers, they would cause more drain. Android's default Doze is good enough IMO.
   6. Prefer Dark / Black themes especially when you have OLED displays.
   7. Disable Fast charging whenever you can.
   8. Keep your battery within 80% - 20% to prolong battery life.


5. **Other tips:**
   1. Use [**Youtube Vanced**](https://vanced.app/) instead of default youtube app. This blocks all ads and allows Background playback, PiP mode and a cool AMOLED black theme.
   2. [**Google Opinion Rewards**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&hl=en_IN) is a neat way to earn Google Play credits that can be used for play store purchases.
   3. If you have a Samsung phone, check out GoodLock suite of apps. They are made by Samsung and offer crazy levels of customization. Also Hex installer is cool if you're into customization.
   4. Reducing animation scale in Developer options will make your phone feel more responsive if you have older phones.
   5. If you don't use Google assistant, disable Microphone access to google app and remove it from Device Assistant app from Settings->App->Default Apps.
   6. Using [**Your phone**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager&hl=en_IN) for Windows or [**KDE Connect**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp&hl=en_IN) for Linux can make things seamless between Phone and PC.
   7. If your phone has NFC, it can be used to automate lot of things by tapping on NFC tags like Turning on WiFi when you enter home, Unlock your PC by having a Tag near it, Having a bed time routine with a Tag on your bed, etc.  Check out [**NFC Tools**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_IN) for more. 
   8. [**Hermit**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&hl=en_IN) can replace many apps like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon with their web versions.
   9. [**Firefox Send**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend&hl=en_IN) can be used to send files < 2GB to anyone through a link.
   10. Replace chrome with [**Kiwi browser**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_IN) or Firefox, they are open-source and support extensions.
   11. Install and enable ADB on your PC and always allow debugging for your phone from your PC. This will come in handy when your display is broken, by controlling screen with scrcpy.
   12. If you have a Snapdragon CPU, there will be a modded version of Google's camera for your phone. It would improve picture quality drastically with Google's HDR+ processing. You can check xda-developers.com for GCam for your device.
   13. snapdrop.net can be used to share files to any device within your network. Just enter the URL in you browser and it'll work.


PS - Be careful when uninstalling system apps. Use a recommended debloat list for your device if you're not sure.

I will be adding more tips here. Suggestions are welcome.

Android,A new look for Google Play family of apps,
Android,Now for Reddit has been reinstated on Google Play. Here's an update and a word of warning for other developers.,"Hey All

On Wednesday *Now for Reddit* was suspended and removed from Google Play. The reason [explained in a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5fqrr8/now_for_reddit_is_suspended_from_google_play/) submitted to r/Android was for violating the 'sexually explicit content' policy. I said I'd keep you updated when I heard more so I'm back with an update and some advice to help other developers avoid getting a similar policy strike :(

Firstly, many thanks to all of you who contacted me. A couple of Googlers who saw the post on r/Android helped bring this unfortunate situation to a brisk resolution.

#The Cause

A representative from Google Play informed me that a post made to r/documentaries was the reason for the suspension. This proves Google has a mechanism (be it manual or automated) to browse through screens when reviewing an app. This may not be a surprise but the post in question was tagged NSFW and so shouldn't have appeared in the app unless the NSFW filters were disabled in the app settings.

#The Solution

I've decided to block all NSFW posts unless you are logged in with your reddit account. This is what the official app does and it should help prevent future suspensions caused by NSFW posts. 

**I'd advise developers of other apps to do the same if you do not already do this.**  

  
All being well [Now for Reddit should be back in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phyora.apps.reddit_now) shortly.

Thanks again for all your messages of support. It's a great relief to be reinstated, losing something I've spent thousands of hours developing would have been a bitter pill to swallow to say the least!

Cheers"

Android,"[Idea] The new ""What song's playing?"" area on Pixel's always-on screen should be a permanent location for Google Now/Assistant notifications (mock-up inside)","We're all familiar with the problem: Google Now cards are supposed to be there right when we need it, presenting us with relevant information without requiring any input from us, but Google never *really* pulled that off. It's still too cumbersome to reach them: you have to go to the Google app, ignore all those news articles you're not really interested in and click the ""Upcoming"" button... and you're never sure if you're gonna find anything in there anyways, it's mostly just the weather, and a traffic update even if you don't own a car or use public transport.

Then I saw the new feature of the Pixels where it inconspicuously displays what song is playing at the moment on the bottom of the always-on display. It's a cute touch, but it's too special a treatment for an ultimately niche feature. What if that area was not used just for song identification, but as a permanent notification area for whatever's the most pertinent/urgent Google Now/Assistant card is at the moment? Where you parked your car, if your flight is delayed, if your package is shipped... the usual stuff, but now it's not bothersome to reach, but not in your way either. Double tapping would take you directly to the ""Upcoming"" tab (or whatever). It could default to weather when there isn't any other urgent info, or it could just be black... 

I think (something like) this could be a much more seamless experience than what we have now. [Here's an album of examples I quickly threw together](https://imgur.com/a/gCHYb). What do you think?"

---

Now that we've seen the announcements from I/O, we've probably all heard of the migration to *[runtime permissions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM)*, which allow you to be asked for permissions while using the app, as opposed to during installation (a good thing). What you also might've heard is that it now relies on permission [categories](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM&t=150) instead of the more specific permission model that was used in the past.

Alongside this change, apps will be [given more permissions by default](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/runtime-permissions.html), even without accepting any permission categories on Android M. One of the permissions that currently [appears to be granted](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-m-preview/core/res/AndroidManifest.xml) by default in Android M is GET_ACCOUNTS, which grants [access to your e-mail address](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2175688) for Google accounts, and even if Google changes this, might still grant access to e-mail addresses belonging to other account types and services. (Thanks to [christop](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9621627) for mentioning this permission.)

**My request to Google:** please don't grant this permission unless the user approves the Contacts category. Please ensure that merely installing the wrong flashlight app, live wallpaper or what-have-you cannot allow my e-mail address to be sent to an organization I've never heard of that is registered in the Seychelles. (Don't forget - full network access comes with all apps in Android M!)

---

*Quit reading here if you're not interested in other issues and vulnerabilities the new model in Android M could cause.*

Aside from e-mail addresses, there are some other permissions I think might be troublesome to automatically grant to apps, and I'm not completely sure yet I've found all of them. I'd like to kindly ask anyone who can to thoroughly review those permissions to ensure that they don't end up as the technical debt that future API levels need to try to fix again, after causing users pain in the mean time.

* READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE isn't used much by the Nexus range, but for many other devices this permission is highly sensitive, containing full device backups, contact backups, and highly sensitive downloads outside of app-specific directories. It was not shown to be one of the new permission categories. How does Android M deal with it? Might it be time to switch away from FAT32 to ext4 to allow for permissions to apply to it?

* CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE is automatically granted and can allow apps to turn on mobile data (and WiFi). This can cost money to the millions of users who have exceeded their data plans or who are on prepaid plans. Suggested fix: a System Settings permission category.

* READ_PHONE_STATE is part of the Phone category, but used to be requested by developers frequently to detect *whether* there was an incoming call so that app audio could be muted. Please ensure that apps cannot get phone numbers without the Phone category, but that apps can still gracefully deal with incoming calls.

* GET_TASKS  is granted by default but was being deprecated. Please disable it in API23 so that apps cannot peek into the thumbnails of other apps. Information shown to the user may be sensitive and must not be seen by other apps.

* SET_WALLPAPER (and its hints) are granted by default and seem like low-impact permissions, but I'm sure that was initially thought of allowing apps to show notifications as well, until push ads came along. Now that the user can disable notifications for specific apps, apps may be inclined to show ads on the wallpaper instead if they're given this permission for free anyway (including ones prompting for virus scans and nonsense like that). I suggest adding this to a new System Settings permission category.

* WRITE_SETTINGS is granted by default, while it used to be treated as quite sensitive. A System Settings category would fix this.

* SET_TIME_ZONE is granted by default, but should also require System Settings.

* MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS is granted by default but allowed for redirecting audio streams, and should require the Microphone permission category. If this is now split off to MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING, consider making that a part of the System Settings category as well, instead of making this functionality impossible for future devices.

* READ_SYNC_SETTINGS, WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS could conceivably leak private details depending on the identity information associated with it. Might make more sense in a System Settings category.

* App names/icons displayed in the permission prompts should match the Play Store name and icon, otherwise apps may be inclined to request permissions as ""Android System"" or something equally serious.

* Contacts is a highly sensitive permission category, especially in conjunction with full network access. In some jurisdictions providing users' personal details such as phone numbers to third parties may even be illegal without the permissions of those contacts, and I think it's frowned upon by many regardless. There should be a way for apps to opt-out of all communication subsystems so that they can be allowed access to sensitive data such as contacts, special files, confidential recordings, etc. ""**Offline apps**"" if you will, which could be a simple label given automatically to all apps that do not request network permissions such as INTERNET, BLUETOOTH etc. This could be the only category whose auto-updates would need to be limited to updates that are also Offline apps. A lack of this feature will pose problems for devices used in high-security environments and could give Android a bad name in the enterprise environment, as nothing could ever be guaranteed to remain private.

If you have any thought on permissions that are inappropriate to grant automatically, please leave a comment. **Did I get something wrong? I'm sorry** - the available information is preliminary and still quite dispersed - again, please leave a comment."

Android,"iPhone X, Pixel 2 XL, Note 8...a poor man's review","I am not a rich man. I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.  

X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...

The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me. 
What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.

FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer. 

However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.

Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...

Being on AT&T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the ""I hate Samsung"" train that is r/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying ""it's sooo smooth!""  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.

The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.   

Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious ""Pure Android"" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience. 

A noteworthy experience, but can it last?

My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g̶i̶m̶m̶i̶c̶k̶ feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen. 

Picasso once said ""Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun."" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but ""THE"" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, ""Smooth now, but give it a month or two..."" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady. 

What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why. 

Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...it’s 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! I’m sorry for yelling, Samsung...please don’t kill off the headphone jack. 

Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased/subsidized through AT&T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one!

Edit:

Great, this has got some attention. Of course I wouldn't limit this to Apps; books, music, movies, etc would all be great if we could gift it! For years now Apple has been beating Google with App revenue. I think, if this was a thing, it could turn around. Look at the Steam Summer Sale for instance; people are throwing their money away like it's nobody's business (myself included) and ~~90% of that~~ from what I've hear, most of the time it's in the form of gifts (I highly suggest going for [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZU64d.png) option so you can later on decide whether you will actually play the game or gift it to someone else).

As many others have pointed out, [Apple has been doing this for a while now](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201783): ""*Through the iTunes Store, iBooks Store, and App Store, you can gift dollar amounts, books, audiobooks, music, movies, TV shows, or apps.*""

Google has recently rolled out a [Google Play Family Plan](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6286986?hl=en) feature.

Android,WARNING to all Wileyfox owners: your location data and WiFi information is being sold,"Recently, the nougat update rolled out for the device. Wileyfox added a feature called Yandex Zen, which is basically a newsfeed with ads. But when delving into the user agreement, dark things are going on. Specially because they sold themselves as privacy oriented, since it came with cyanogen installed. 

- It collects location data and WiFi information, amongst other things. 

- It sells this data to third parties. 

- It cannot be uninstalled. 

- Since the app is integrated, it bypasses android permissions. 

All this combined, this means that they just take every user's digital data and sell it for profit. All of this without asking or warning about, nor the possibility to stop it.

Supposedly in the next update it will become uninstallable, but by then the advertisers will already have a good profile of every user.

And since some OEMs like LG, Xiaomi, One plus, Huawei and even some custom ROMs have implemented it (even if it is half-baked) it should be somewhat easy for Google to do so at the AOSP level. 

The official implementation is part of the Bluetooth spec, [it's called BAS](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications), but only Apple has officially implemented it. I'd LOVE for Google to get on it!

Android,"Hey /r/android! Oneplus broke camera2 api since the 7.0 update on OP3(T), rendering the phone unstable (as proved inside). Refuses to fix it, ignoring the all the complains. We need your help to show them how unacceptable this behavior is."," 
Hey /r/android!  
  
We all praise the efforts from OEMs to keep our phones with the latest software. We love the updates for the new functionalities, increased stability or even for the sake of having a higher number buried on ""about the phone"" section. However it all goes to waste when companies, in this case, oneplus, break and/or limit functionalities which were working good, with a new update iteration.  
  
In this particular case, when the nougat update first started to roll out, people noted strange behaviors when using third party cameras (the ones that rely on camera2 API). Under some situations, the phones would hang for a long long time, crash, and display strange artifacts on the viewfinder. As it impacted heavily the phone camera usage, these issues were massively reported on oneplus forums, twitter and xda. (even by the creator of the known OpenCamera). Despite that, they got ignored, report after report, and still, to this day, almost a year later, there wasn't any official position on the issue  
  
  
On the other hand, using the stock camera app won't reveal any issues. Why? Because it's using a modded legacy API (with HAL3 for the front camera according to sultanxda) to make it work. (The fact that an OEM is still using this method in 2017/18 would deserve its own discussion, but I will leave as it is, since it's not particularly relevant for this topic). But, as you may ask, if the stock camera works seamlessly, why do we need to rely on 3rd party ones?  
  
Several reasons tbh:  
  
- Useless panorama mode  
- **Lack of more advanced controls like intervalometer, exposure metering mode**  
- **Lack of manual video settings**  
- Low quality 1080p time lapse mode  
- No sound with slow motion  
- (you tell me) /s  
  
For those who might have interest on the topic, I'll shed this additional information.  
  
- The camera will always crash during when pointed to bright scenes under some combinations of ISO and shutter speed.  
  
- The exif data (ISO and shutter speed) is incorrectly reported on dark scenes  
  
- Using full auto will allow higher than 799 ISO to be picked by the camera (despite the live stats of the app only read as 799). As soon as you force a manual control, the usable ISO range will be 100-799. Any higher than that and it is the same as 799.  
  
These itself result on a partially useless camera2 API implementation which, if it wasn't enough already, make the phone unstable for every user. All it takes is a camera app download from the play store.  
  
  
Detailed reports can be found [HERE (XDA)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-3t/how-to/camera2-bugs-t3569283) [HERE (ONEPLUS)](https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/camera2-api-bugs-for-3rd-party-camera-apps.506100/) and [HERE (oneplus)](https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/camera-api-2-iso-settings-restricted.569762/)  
  
  
**Side note:** currently Google camera port is not 100% stable on our device for the same freaking reason, as it relies solely on camera API.  
  
-  
  
  
I don't like to free bash on companies, but this behavior is just unacceptable.   
Can't just understand how can oneplus have a device unstable for a year without the intention to fix that. I'm really trying to bring attention to this as it is not a minor bug at all.  
  
If this post leads to nowhere, at least I'm trying to inform people of the oneplus *modus operandi*. I still think their hardware is awesome (including my OP3T) but these decisions and the lacking support push me away from a future buy.  
Never settle you say?  
  
  
-  
  
  
  
**TL;DR: Oneplus broke the camera2api since nougat update. Refuses to fix it, there are no official answers, despite it being reported countless times. All OP3(T) on nougat or oreo are not stable. Will face reboots and crashes under some usage patterns due to this problem** 
 

**EDIT:**

Thanks for the support guys!
I've uploaded two videos showing the bug to make our message more clear.

[Max/Reported ISO bug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWPgj82vIqM)
[Phone Crashing and turning unresponsive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWA5Sws8rQA)


I believe that we, android users, should have to option to choose. It's even more valid if we consider that our phone was marketed for, not only obviously, enthusiasts. 

That's why we fight to have the api working again. There are people who will find use in being able to shoot 500 30 secs 3200 ISO RAW photos 10 seconds to each other. Other will find the ability to shoot log video at a fixed 1/48 exposure @24p to post produce later on computer. Other will just download GCAM mod and find that actually we can get some flagship level shots from this phone. That's all about what an open and enthusiast phone should be. I simply refuse to accept the situation which looks like a half made job. It's even worse when your new product suffers from similar issues. Oneplus has the funds and dimension to correct address this problem. There's no way a phone with a 440€ price tag can be unstable when using any legit camera app, from the playstore itself, as long as it uses the HAL3.

**EDIT2:** There's a petition up and running that Agent 8923 linked @ comments section

[LINK](https://www.change.org/p/oneplus-oneplus-stop-ignoring-customers-and-fix-the-oneplus-3t-camera)

**EDIT3:** Got a reddit PM from oneplus support. I know it does not mean much as lots of us reported the problem via submission forms and oneplus forums. I've told @oneplus via twitter about the problem 3 times only to be asked to use the bug submition form, which has resulted in nothing. I'm gathering all the info I can (logcats, dumps, crashing patterns, video proof, etc) to send them ASAP (and again lol). I will keep you updated later if it leads to somewhere

(x-post from /r/GalaxyS6),"Old lady drives down from Reno to a Starbucks in Sacramento (2 hour, 100 mile drive) I just happen to be sitting in at that time. She is there to purchase a $400 (MSRP $650) Galaxy S6. 30 minutes later (rudely late) a well built guy with a red striped brotank walks in, sits down with the lady. The S6 is uncharged because its ""new"". He makes small talk and plugs it in to charge. While it's charging, he tries to get the money from her right there and then (complaining about being in a rush), but thankfully, she doesn't give in and is adamant to see the S6 functioning.

I decide get up and walk by and notice the charger appears to be fake. To take a closer look, I ask if I can hold the ""S6"" so ""i can get to see what a white S6 looks like"" in comparison to my Black S6, look at the back, FCC tags are obviously fake (Thanks to the video below, I was able to recognize this S6 as a fake immediately). I say ""I need to order a drink"" to excuse myself from the seat, and ask starbucks staff if they can do anything about the scam about to take place, they can't. They tell me to ""Follow your heart"". (or some fucking bullshit, as they can't do anything store policy etc)

I decide to pull her aside and tell her its 100% fake, to walk away from this deal, and to not look back. She goes into the bathroom and locks herself in there (afraid that she might get followed if she got in her car) Scammer walks away looking fucking pissed and gives me a look as if he's gonna beat me into pieces.

Android,Google announces Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL starting at 799$,
Android,Shuttle Music Player is now open source!,"Hey /r/Android,

Over the years, I've given thought to the idea of open sourcing Shuttle. I enjoy open sourcing stuff - it's nice to be able to show off what you can do, help others, and also get some help in return. It's also nice to give back - without open source, Shuttle wouldn't exist.

For those who don't know it, Shuttle is a local music player for Android. 

Check it out [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player), or via the [website](https://www.shuttlemusicplayer.com)

It started off in early 2012 as a project to learn how to code. With some really positive feedback and encouragement from /r/Android, and as my skills developed it slowly picked up momentum, and became a relatively successful app (at least in my books), reaching around 4 million downloads, and earning ~$AU150k in its 4 years of life.

I'm really proud of what I've been able to do with the app. It's led to a job as a full-time app developer, and I now develop both iOS and Android apps full-time. 

It's worth noting though, that none of this was possible without open source, and help from the kind of people who love open source. When I was starting out, I discovered Apollo Music Player, and its developer, Andrew Neal. I sent him a bunch of emails asking how he managed to get around certain problems in the app. Although I considered the apps to be sort of in competition with one another, he couldn't have been more approachable and happy to help. Over emails, hangouts and eventually Slack, he ended up teaching me how to use Git, Eclipse (ugh), Java patterns, and tons more. Basically, he unwittingly and enthusiastically became a sort of mentor. It still surprises me to this day how someone can be so happy to take time out of their day just to show some random stranger on the internet how to do something. Yet, the same thing happens to me now, from time to time I'll get hit up on hangouts with someone asking how I solved a problem in Shuttle, and though it's not much effort for me, I always remember to pay it forward.

So, here's hoping that Shuttle can be to someone else, what Apollo was to me!

[Shuttle Music Player on Github](https://www.github.com/timusus/Shuttle)


---

For developers:


Part of the motivation behind open sourcing Shuttle is also because I'd like to see the development move ahead a bit faster. In other words, I'm looking for **contributors**. So, if you're a beginner looking to get your hands dirty, or there's just that one feature that's lacking, and you think you know how to solve it, please feel free to give it a crack. Open an issue or make a pull request.

I don't have as much free time as I used to, and I also find that one of the downsides to working full-time as an app developer, is I'm less enthusiastic about writing code late into the night. Also, weirdly, the better I get at coding, the higher my standards are, and the *longer* it takes me to get things done.

I'm still actively developing Shuttle though, and I'll try to be as responsive as possible when discussing features, pull-request & bugs.

Shuttle uses a few modern technologies & libraries, including RXJava, Retrofit and Glide - and I think there's plenty to discover there for all kinds of developers.

However, I'm no expert. So, if you see some crazy piece of code that makes your eyes bleed, make a PR or let me know!


For Shuttle users:

Hopefully Shuttle will become a bit more active, and you'll start seeing some more features sooner.

I'm also using a public issue tracker now (https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues), so it should become a little easier to track the progress of feature requests and bug fixes.


---

I'm really excited about this new chapter for Shuttle, but it's quite nerve-racking as well.. Shuttle development has been a dictatorship for the last 4 years, where I've had the final say on everything. I'm now stepping back a little bit to allow others to contribute, so that will take some adjustment.

The other scary thing is putting all this code out there for everyone to see. I imagine this is how Cersei felt being marched naked to the Red Keep. I can imagine some developers digging around in the code and ringing a bell, crying 'shame, shame'. There are a few shameful bits of code, but there's some gold in these hills as well.


Anyway, I'm probably gonna fall asleep pretty soon, but I'll be back in a few hours to answer questions, so AMA away.

Edit: I have to sleep now, it's 3am in Aus. I'll be back to answer more questions in a little while. 

Edit 2: OK, I'm back!"

I couldn't get in via Android Device Manager, because it no longer removes your current lock, so I factory data reset my device, thinking that Factory Reset Protection would ask for my google password and all would be well.

Well, as of 8.1, it doesn't any longer. Now, instead, Factory Reset Protection asks you for you ""previously used secret"" and gives no option to change the input from pattern (in my case) to anything else. Google technical support confirmed this by requesting I factory reset again, and then replacing my device via RMA.

I also tried flashing 8.0 factory images, and even downgrading my device doesn't work. I get an error from fastboot that is virtually ungoogleable. It says [FAILED \(remote: check device console\)](https://imgur.com/a/bu3te)

The notification drawer isn't a canvas for you to spew your marketing bullshit at me. If something appears there, it should be because I've elected to be notified of something. Stop making that decision for me. All it gets you is your app uninstalled

EDIT: Since this blew up, I'd like to address a couple points people have been making:

* Words With Friends is apparently a bad example, since they have a paid version which removes the ads. It's nice that I have that option, and if I played the game more frequently I likely would pony up for it (although, ironically, playing more would also remove their ""you don't play enough"" ad). But there are many apps that DON'T have paid alternatives and don't give you an option to block unsolicited notifications.

* Blocking notifications from an app is an option, but it needs more fine-grained control. I don't want to blanket block every notification. In the WWF example, I still want to know when it's my turn in a currently active game, but I DON'T want a prompt saying I should start a new one. I'd love to see an update to the notification API that made developers register each possible notification their app will push with the system, then at a system level let the user decide which ones can and can't appear. 

* Uninstalling the app is what usually ends up happening, but for some apps, the pros of having the app outweigh this con, so it becomes harder to send the message. So I don't see it as a good solution in general. 

Again these are just my thoughts, although I'm glad to see people tend to agree with me on it."

Android,How I learned to develop Android apps in a little over a month,"A month and two weeks ago, I knew nothing about Java. I knew some C from an intro class I took Freshman year of college. Today I released my first Android app. These are the steps I took.
- - -
#Starting out

I started because I found myself with a good amount of free time, and wanted to do something constructive (3000+ hours of League of Legends was just too much). I looked up app development as I've always been interested, and was inspired by [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1s347g/how_i_learned_to_develop_android_apps_in_less/)
Does it really take a year? I decided to try and find out.

First step was learning Java. I went through and did every exercise from [this website](https://programmingbydoing.com/), although I did skip the GUI/Graphics stuff because Android Studio would hopefully take care of it. This took me about 3-4 days. At the end of it, I had a pretty solid understanding of what Java is and fundamentally how to use it. 
- - -
#Learning Android Studio

So with Java under my belt (EDIT: okay not really but enough to start), I downloaded Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) and went straight to the Training course offered directly from Google ([here](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html)). 

At first, Android Studio was a nightmare. I had **no idea** what was going on. I spent a day trying to get the basic ""Hello World"" program to run, despite the code already being done (Google puts it in there at the start of a new project). Once I was able to do that, I simply tried adding things to it... a random text box, some buttons. This part was somewhat familiar, as it was similar to using the drawing tools in Microsoft Word (dragging and dropping shapes). 

Once I had a inkling of how the user interface builder worked, I went further into Google's training program, learning how to start a new ""Activity"" (a new window in your app.. sorta) by pressing a button. 

I found a few more similar tutorials on the web, and followed them just to learn how Android Studio works. All in all this took me about a week and a half. 
- - -
#Starting my first app

Someone once told me the golden rule to learning programming is simply to pick a random project and do it. So that's what I did. As a first project, picking a utility app (like a calculator, stopwatch, etc.) is easiest.

My idea was theoretically simple: make an app that will tell you which of your friends is the best at texting. I decided to make a list of project ""implementation steps"" and cross them out as I finished them. You can see my list [here.](http://i.imgur.com/HATpGht.jpg)
- - -
#Programming my app

The next month, up to today, was spent building my app. The idea turned out to be much more complicated than I had thought, but I stuck to my plan. Most of my learning came from googling how to do something, finding a similar example, and trying to tweak it to fit my project. I became quite adept at googling.

I won't go into the details here, but the important thing is I now **know enough to build a complete app.**

- - -
Through this experience, I found a new passion for programming. Hopefully someone else reading this can too.

If you'd like to check out what I made, [my app is on the play store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beau.textrank) 


**TL;DR**
I went from nothing to making my first app in a little over a month, mostly by making a plan and sticking to it.

Android,PSA: Ebay/Amazon seller BREED is flashing carrier phones and selling them as new & unlocked,"So two weeks ago I came across what appeared to be an awesome Deal of the Day on amazon for a brand-new LG V30+ (you can see the discussion of the deal here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9wflm3/lg\_electronics\_v30\_factory\_unlocked\_phone\_128gb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9wflm3/lg_electronics_v30_factory_unlocked_phone_128gb/))

I was a little nervous, since some of the comments over at Slickdeals mentioned that the seller, BREED, had poor user reviews over the past month. Still, ""nothing ventured, nothing gained,"" so I bit the bullet and went for it. I was excited enough when the phone arrived to mostly overlook the fact that it the tamper seal sticker looked odd ([https://imgur.com/7ZwA1Jf](https://imgur.com/7ZwA1Jf)). Booting the phone up I found that the phone had a faulty screen, so I returned it through Amazon. I reordered a replacement (hoping I just got unlucky), and received it yesterday.

Same cut tamper sticker ([https://imgur.com/fnAIVKQ](https://imgur.com/fnAIVKQ)). Reviews mentioned that the model didn't match the listing, so I checked. The model was listed as unlocked, US998, but the phone showed the Sprint model, LS998, on the box and on the back ([https://imgur.com/sL9vBbR](https://imgur.com/sL9vBbR)). In the phone settings, though, it showed the listed model: [https://imgur.com/oeZsqbU](https://imgur.com/oeZsqbU). So clearly BREED are taking (cheaper) Sprint models, flashing them to the unlocked firmware, and passing them off as brand-new original unlocked LG V30+. 

I'm pissed. I spent a lot of time looking into this phone and it frustrates me immensely that BREED is getting away with a bait and switch here. Looking at their reviews, it seems like they do this thing a lot. Contacting them they claimed that they just ran out of US998 phones, and the cut sticker was just their quality check: [https://imgur.com/X1HztF0](https://imgur.com/X1HztF0). Bullshit. They opened the phone to flash the new firmware, which also means the phones can't OTA software updates AND means you don't get the 2-year LG warranty. Hopefully this posts reaches someone thinking about buying a phone from BREED and convinces them otherwise. It's not worth it.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: BREED (seller) is pulling a bait-and-switch, selling flashed carrier phones as unlocked with no disclaimer. No warranty and no OTA updates with these phones."

Background: So basically the user is complaining in a review about an app having ads, the thing is this app (FX File Explorer) does not have any ads even in [free version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx), let alone the [paid version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx.rk). (As listed in Play Store listing as well as mentioned by the developer)

Issues:

1. The terrible situation with Adware/Bloated apps that shows ads all over the phone (even in/over other apps) completely ruining the experience and Google lists them as Top Free Apps. This deserves a facepalm. (This apps mainly uses ""Draw over other apps"" permission)

2. The permissions asked by these apps.

3. The terrible state of Reviews in Google Play Store. Fake reviews, Bots etc. (Also been discussed in this threads [a month ago](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/60w0qu/fake_reviews_somebody_is_buying_thousands_of/) and [a year ago](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4hwgsw/google_play_full_of_fake_reviews/))

4. No option for users to see Upvoted/Downvoted reviews or comment on them. (Like reviews in Amazon reviews for example or even Reddit itself for what it's worth)

5. People leaving 1-star reviews without even explaining/writing why. (Seriously, why is this even allowed)

Lastly, this was inspired by [another thread](https://reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/66lmaf/hate_idiots_like_these_leaving_reviews_for_the/) by /u/defectiveawesomdude (Thanks!)

Android,Leading Android scientific calculator now requires Caller ID,"**Disclaimer**: I’m developing a competing application, [Natural Scientific Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=roviminteractive.materialcopy) so I ~~might be a little~~ am biased. Nonetheless, all the following is factually correct and referenced for your convenience.

Recently I was scoping out our competition and stumbled upon an app named “[Scientific Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scaleasw.powercalc)” by Sappalodapps. I found out that they had added a new feature: Caller ID. I thought to myself, “why in the world would a scientific calculator provide Caller ID?”

So I looked at the permissions that they requested: They need access to your entire contacts book, they need to know your precise location using GPS, they need to be able to read all your call history and they need to read your entire storage. I know for a fact that none of these are necessary for a calculator app. [\[1\]](http://imgur.com/G0VyeMG)

So why would they request so many permissions?

After some thought, it was clearly to generate more revenue which the developers themselves confirmed: “...it helps us fund further development of the app. If you don't like the feature you can always turn it off in the settings.” [[2]](http://imgur.com/Wjkgsk6) 

If they were struggling for revenue, why wouldn’t they simply add advertising to the app? With the millions of users that they had, advertising should definitely have provided a liveable wage. After some snooping around it turns out that the developers were both greedy and misleading. They didn’t opt for ordinary and non-intrusive advertising because the revenue they stood to gain paled in comparison to the Caller ID system that they chose to implement. [\[3\]](http://calldorado.com/calldorado-instasquare-case/) Furthermore, they flat out lied when they claim in their description that their app is “Advertisement free!” [\[4\]](http://imgur.com/4fsSGJJ) 

This is what happens when you get a call with this app installed (I’ve blurred out the name and phone number):

[Screenshot](http://imgur.com/omHLtN3)

When the call ends, it serves up some advertising (so much for “no ads”):

[Screenshot](http://imgur.com/Ox5NwJK)

Believe it or not **it gets EVEN worse.** 

I decided to take a look at the legal disclaimer and this is what I found out. The Caller ID service is provided by a company that’s unfortunately but aptly named CIAmedia (not affiliated with the Central Intelligence Agency). I say aptly named, since they literally track who you call and harvest the entirety of your phone’s data, whether it be your location, or call logs to show you targeted ads! 

They even boast about it on their website: 

“CIAmedia's unique ad targeting technology knows which businesses, phone numbers or even local contacts a user is calling. We mix this valuable info with other targeting criteria like gender, age and location.” [\[5\]](http://ciamedia.com/targeting/ )


As a developer and a devoted user of Android this really disgusts me. The reason why I decided to develop Natural Scientific Calculator was because of the horrible state of calculator apps on Android. All of them had clunky one line displays, outdated Gingerbread-esque design and required users to navigate using buttons rather than touch. And to top it off, now one of the leading scientific calculator apps on the store is trying to mine our personal details to increase their revenue.

I have a tip - maybe instead of trying to squeeze every last bit of personal information from your users to generate ad revenue, make a better scientific calculator that users will actually pay for. 

Now looking back, it seems like the phenomena of flashlight apps and their ridiculous requests for permissions were a sign of things to come. It’s clearly evident that the practice of requesting permissions to harvest user data is becoming increasingly widespread on the Android platform.
________________________________________________

**TL;DR**: Leading scientific calculator app adds Caller ID feature to mine call history and GPS location to serve lucrative ads to users. 

_____________________________________________________________

**EDIT 1**: Extremely shameless plug but the scientific calculator I'm developing is very different from the rest on the store, since it allows you to touch to navigate and write equations as you would on paper. And it definitely does NOT request ridiculous permissions. We really need some help getting discovered. If you're looking for one you know where to go :P
 
[**Play Store Link**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=roviminteractive.materialcopy)

**EDIT 2**: Okay, another major problem of Android is this. You know what **allows** apps to pull stuff like this? The lack of movement in the search results of the Play Store. Compared to the App Store, the volatility of rankings is virtually non-existent. That's why you end with the problem of apps misusing their position at the top of the search results - either by not updating their design/functionality (e.g. RealCalc) or by adding Caller ID to milk their users dry (e.g. Scientific Calculator by Sappalodapps). They can do this because their rankings don't get affected! They were there 3 or 4 years ago and they'll stay at the top of the search results, simply by virtue of getting there early, rather than being the best. "

I tried it with the trigger being ""panic mode"" for more general use. *Summary - Any Nest or Google Home devices in your home will activate based on these hotwords as well but be unable to activate them on your phone.*

**Edit 4 REQUEST:** Has anyone been able to get Google Assistant to auto stream to any platform? If yes, please tag me in your comment and I will update the post with your instructions.

**Edit 5**: A few folks have commented on the laws of recording interactions with police. Summary: Notify the police that the interaction is being recorded. Please check with your state laws on recording during traffic stops. The ACLU link above has some great details on your rights.

**Edit 6**:  from [andyooo](https://www.reddit.com/user/andyooo) \-  There are apps like Nova Launcher mentioned below (and Tasker) that have a ""system lock"" action, which disables biometrics (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7imzv1/tip_quickly_disable_fingerprint_unlock_and/) for more). This necessarily requires device admin permission so you have to reasonably trust the app. Someone in the comments mentioned [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsc.lock) and said they were using exactly in the way you intend it too, just add ""open Lock"" to your Assistant routine. If you don't trust the app but trust Tasker and Tasker Factory's developer, you can use them to make a ""system lock"" task, then export it as app and give it any name you want (e.g. so it's unambiguous to Assistant what it should ""open""). Going that way I'd recommend targeting an older API because targeting a recent one for some reason requires the app running as a foreground service.

**Edit 7**: from [xcheet](https://www.reddit.com/user/xcheet) \-  Google Home is not needed. Routines can be created inside Assistant using the instructions on this page: [Check Google Support](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7672035?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) "

**[UPDATED POST](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11r7dwk/last_update_on_the_samsung_moon_controversy_and/)**

Original post:

There were some great suggestions in the comments to my original post and I've tried some of them, but the one that, in my opinion, really puts the nail in the coffin, is this one:

I photoshopped one moon next to another (to see if one moon would get the AI treatment, while another would not), and managed to coax the AI to do exactly that.

This is the image that I used, which contains 2 blurred moons: https://imgur.com/kMv1XAx

I replicated my original setup, shot the monitor from across the room, and got this: https://imgur.com/RSHAz1l

As you can see, one moon got the ""AI enhancement"", while the other one shows what was actually visible to the sensor - a blurry mess

I think this settles it.

EDIT: I've added this info to my original post, but am fully aware that people won't read the edits to a post they have already read, so I am posting it as a standalone post

EDIT2: **Latest update, as per request:**

1) Image of the blurred moon with a superimposed gray square on it, and an identical gray square outside of it - https://imgur.com/PYV6pva

2) S23 Ultra capture of said image - https://imgur.com/oa1iWz4

3) Comparison of the gray patch on the moon with the gray patch in space - https://imgur.com/MYEinZi

As it is evident, the gray patch in space looks normal, no texture has been applied. The gray patch on the moon has been filled in with moon-like details.

It's literally adding in detail that weren't there. It's not deconvolution, it's not sharpening, it's not super resolution, it's not ""multiple frames or exposures"". It's generating data."

Android,"Many Galaxy S23/S23+ have an hardware issue on the main camera that causes permanent blurred and smudged spots, Samsung refuses to aknowledge the issue and fix it.","As soon as I received my Galaxy S23, I noticed that there was a problem with the camera: there is frequently a blurry and smudged area on the left side of the photos shot with the device (in landscape, on the top side in portrait shots). This makes photos of documents and text almost unusable sometimes, but it's noticeable in all kinds of photos taken at a distance too.

It turns out that this problem is very widespread on these two devices, and numerous users have provided examples: [https://imgur.com/a/MXXkn0O](https://imgur.com/a/MXXkn0O)

You can even see it in the [GSM Arena camera comparison tool](https://www.gsmarena.com/piccmp.php3?idType=4&idPhone1=12083&idPhone2=12082&idPhone3=11908) on their S23+, by panning over to the London map and the black/red cushion underneath [(screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/Lgod9Js.png). You can also see that their S23, with the exact same camera, has no such problem.

A user sent their device to an official Samsung Service Center and the technicians recognized the issue, but they couldn't make a repair because for now the official Samsung stance is that ""it's a characteristic of the big sensor"" and it's normal (""[enjoy the DSLR-like bokeh effect](https://i.imgur.com/JUlUvDK.png)""), intentionally mixing up this issue with the normal depth of field limitations of smartphone cameras in close-ups and completely ignoring the fact that the smudged spot appears even on distant subjects and documents well inside the focus range of the sensor.

The device is now stuck at the Service Center since March 23rd, and the technicians don't have guaranteed non-faulty camera modules to make a repair even if they wanted to. Someone else had their camera module swapped with another with the exact same issue.

It's disheartening to think that I spent so much money on a flagship device from a reputable brand in order to avoid problems like this, and to have access to top-notch customer service if something did go wrong. Unfortunately, the situation has turned out to be the opposite.

EDIT:

According to a [poll made by a German forum](https://www.android-hilfe.de/forum/samsung-galaxy-s23.4144/umfrage-zur-kamera-des-s23-plus-unschaerfebanane-bitte-keine-diskussionen-dafuer-gibt-es-den-entsprechenden-bereich.1056738.html), only 7 out of 71 users were not affected by this issue.

Another [poll on an Italian forum](https://i.imgur.com/yS5nroy.png) showed that 17 users out of 25 had it.

Also the S23 Ultra, as far as we know, does not have this issue.

Android,I use it all the time to more easily switch text from my android phone to my apple laptop since they are not easily compatible/ file shareable.,
Android,Android Auto allows you to capture notes in Keep using voice. So many ideas and reminders captured on the fly while sitting in traffic. I love it and never have to worry about forgetting anything.,

Android,Camera is much better on Android,
Android,"Been using Keeps on Android but since watching your video, will use it also on my desktop. Thanks again!",
Android,"I didn’t even know Keep existed! Thanks! I like how it integrates my IPad and Android phone. I don’t quite understand how to get things from Gmail to my calendars though. I would love a video help for that! BTW, so happy to see you got a puppy! I just watched an older video ( just found your YT site) where you didn’t want to see pics of your dog who passed away. Hope this brings you peace. 😊",
Android,"For me, even Google Keep is bloated, with features I don't need and will never use (if I need toothpaste, I need it now, well before the next time I walk into the drug store 🙂). For those who've managed to simplify their lives to the point that they merely need a digital version of the paper note we all used to leave on the counter or put on the refrigerator door (as well as those who do not care to share endless personal info with Google) I've always found ColorNote to be a TRULY simple (and lean, too) Android app.",

One thing I wish I could do with keep is link to other notes within Keep.  That ability would add so much power.  I could then make a note with an entry to build a bird house then link to a note with a list of things to buy at the hardware store.  The problem is, obviously, once we convince Google to add all of these neat features we have something so bloated that it no longer works.  😞",

Android,Been using Google Keep for several years now.  However never used it on a computer.   Only Android devices.   Thanks for the Tips.,
Android,I use google keep a lot for notes and reminders for the out family or calibration with friends but use iOS notes for my personal note taking.  Both are fine but since I have a personal iPhone and a business android phone I do use keep more between my two phones.,
Android,"Keep is a great (simple) note taking app that Google should really put more resources towards. I switched from Evernote to it years ago and unfortunately have reached the point where it stops functioning (crashes, hangs, etc.). The problem seems to be that it was not (from what it seems) initially designed for large note sets, so as your note database grows you will start to see a tremendous slow down in performance and search, to the point where the app will just lookup and crash (tested across numerous Android devices to confirm behavior).

I've submitted quite a lot of bug reports about the performance degradation on Android and they never seem to get fixed .. seems to be a project with minimal resources given to it.

The only way I've found to combat this is to write a program that auto archives notes after a week. Seems a lot of the issue is in the size of the non-archived notes API calls. Once it reaches a certain amount, performance drops off a cliff (I'm guessing it has a set amount that can fit into an API call before it becomes multiple API calls).",
Android,Excellent video but I have Android on my cell phone and I can't find Keep on the phone.  Must say that this is my first cell phone which I had to reluctantly buy because everything is on a cell phone.  Maybe Keep isn't on the phone but I don't know cell phones and really don't want or need all the features they have.  Question is how do I find Keep on my phone if I have it?,
Android,"Nice vid. Have iOS n android(pixel 4a). U can also sync ur iOS notes with google keep. The voice memo to text is amazing. Can’t tell you how many times I used voice memos on iOS just to type it out later. I wish Siri didn’t suck. Also, somewhat unrelated, is reminders on android. When you ask Google assistant to remind you of something it automatically goes on Google calendar and then automatically moves over to the next day until you complete it. It’s the most simple and useful calendar/reminder feature for me. The only reason I’m back on iOS is because Google decided to no longer let me use the Google assistant while the phone is locked. Peace.",

I have been playing with the Microsoft Lens, it's pretty cool.  can't wait until they have some sort of device you attach to your glasses and connect with bluetooth.",
Android,"Thanks mucho.
I use Keep for lots of notes but I was unaware that I could drop videos and web pages into it. It even generates a title 👍
So now I can save the interesting stuff in Keep and add a few notes of my own.
Previously I would save to my Gmail and then move to a folder.
Btw when I dictate a note on my Android phone I don't get the audio file. Not a problem as the speech to text is very good. Even for a Glasgow accent 😀",
Android,I use Keep to make all my Calendar reminders because it them 'keeps' them all in one place if I need to make any modifications. If I use the reminder system built in to Calendar then to make a modification to a reminder you must find the date that the reminder is set to. It also makes for an easy way to cut & paste data between Android & MS Windows,
Android,Totally agree. I use Keep mainly for idea captures or short note and maintaining my shopping list. I love that I can use it both on my iPad and my android phone.,
Android,"Keep is one of the few _must install first_ apps on my Android devices. Just a couple of points... 

(1) with the app (on Android at least) you don't _have_ to be online. So if you're not near WiFi and you like to keep your mobile data off when you don't absolutely need it, Keep still works just fine. It will synch when it has the opportunity. Even voice recognition works without a connection. 

(2) You're not locked into Google when you want to use the web-based version. Works just as well with, say, Opera (my 1st choice) or Firefox. 

(3) Once the app's on your device, Keep is on your _share_ menu. So adding a note with a link to a YouTube video or some highlighted text or a website is only as far away as that share button. And of course when you do that a lot, group and organize them with labels and colors.",
Android,"I use Google tasks as a do to list, very simple and works across Android phone, iPad and on PC,on web alongside Google Calendar. Don’t use Apple Notes as, although have an iPad, I don’t have an Apple phone or laptop. I have recently started using Joplin and am very impressed, I sync it to Dropbox. It works across all devices.",
Android,"+Pocketful of Primary 
Well Michelle , 
Let me put it like this since I am an Android Person I do want to let you know that Google Keep and Google Tasks are available on Android Phones in fact they work hand in hand with Google Drive .  Pretty much anything Google works seamlessly on an Android Device .
Anyhow , thank you for the tips on what you use and how you use them because it can help someone out there who has an Apple iDevice out there learn how to use it to get what they want done .

Buuuuuuut iPhone is definitely not the next big ticket...

Although a good video, the video missed some extremely key items.

For starters,  folk should expect the Google gmail market share to grow...

Reasons....
1. Android is dominant in the cellphone space and u need a Gmail account. Once u synch your Gmail to your phone, most folk do not like change. Soooooo....the purchase of a new phone means folk are staying with Gmail. So that helps with retention, but children do what they see. Soooooo.... the next generation as they become of age will be getting android phones with the associated Gmail account.

2. Electronic devices and the Internet of Things. Whether we are talking about a smart TV or folks linking their lights, security camera systems, stereo systems, or even their doors and sprinkler systems and thermostats, the future is likely the Internet of Things and it is only logical to expect that Android i.e. Google will likely be an industry leader in that space. Buuuuuuut no mention of the Internet of Things in the entire video.

3. Electronic cars. Of course, I am screaming Bah Humbug!  Buuuuuuut battery operated cars are essentially here and with so many EVs coming equipped with the ugly tablet style interfaces, it is not logical to think that the Android platform would not have a role.

I will say this....

Again, not expecting Gmail to lose any market share in the email world anytime soon, buuuuuuuuuut the Gdrive has to be one of the most underrated and undermarketed features of Google. The synch feature really is the real deal! It is not very user-friendly for sharing files, but the synch itself is outright amazing!

Now Microsoft OneDrive?

Great in concept, but as I type I become angrier and angrier just thinking about OneDrive! Lol... Curse u Bill Gates or whoever the pretend leader of Microsoft is these days. Lol.....

Buuuuuuuut at the end of the day....

Google can conquer all industries, buuuuuuut without an email manager to compete with Outlook, they will never be able to replace Microsoft in businesses, education, or government. Outlook is God's gift to the planet. Among other things of course. Lol....

Soooo...yeah... Microsoft's position is locked in.

Also, I think it would have been nice if the video had done a survey to ask....What is a person's primary email account? And provided that statistic in the video especially broken down by generations if possible.

For example, I have I think 2 Gmail accounts, but I only have them for the reasons mentioned in the video plus Android cellphone.

Buuuuuuut my primary email account is Hotmail and I have had that account for a bazillion years at this point.

In either case...

On a scale of 1 to 10....I give the video a 6, slightly better than average, but it really missed some opportunities to discuss some very interesting statistics.

Welp...

That's it for me....

😁",
Android,You failed to mention Google Maps and Android. Every android user has a Gmail account and android has more market share than Apple. I see a lot of bias in this video,
Android,"You just have to decide on which type of tech user you are to find the best email client:
choose google if you have an android phone and any other PC mainly used for personal use and don´t care about privacy. Most of its services are free or very cheap.

Choose microsoft if your PC is used mainly for work, and you´ll probably want your company to get you a high end android or iphone since the outlook app on older versions of android isn´t the best.

Choose apple if you have an iphone and a mac, plus a really good wallet to backup your value of privacy... oh, and/or aren´t tech literate at all since most of this security can be replaced with actually knowing how to navigate the internet safely and basic knowledge of how data works.

For me gmail client and email service just makes everything more convenient and the app actually works pretty well... I don´t mind ""being the product"", in the end email client´s parent corporations will make money off of us with other products, be it overpriced Iphones and expensive apps with apple, our data with google or Office software integrations with microsoft.",
Android,Y don't think that Gmail will lose users  at least all Android phones regardless what brand  an die have Google service integration  and Google + disappeared from common user but if you have a work or school Google account you wil have Google +  bun not for home users,
Android,"Fifteen years of publicly available Gmail and I still have yet to figure out how to automatically sort email exactly to my specifications. My personal Gmail account has almost purely been YouTube, Android, and Docs fodder.",
Android,"0:40
That's *clearly* not a global market share number that you're looking at.
Apple may dominate the US, UK and Scandinavia.
But Android actually has a larger market share in more countries.
And there's a certain correlation with wealth.
10:15
In what markets?",
Android,"I use Google and Yahoo email services.  I'm an Android phone user. When I recently bought an iPad for music performance,  I set it up with most of the Google suite, including Home.  At least it's an interface that feels the same regardless of the device.",
Android,"I think just looking at GMAIL does not tell the full story. 
During the last year the total number of new smartphones sold was declining. Only Apple has constant high numbers. This means the Android ecosystem becomes smaller. (data: Counterpoint). Gmail might be the smallest of Googles problems.",
Android,Setting up outlook was a headache for me. Google is simple. Plus most android phones have gmail,
Android,"With the minuscule sample size of my friends, acquaintances, and colleagues- I can assure you NO ONE I KNOW has ditched Gmail for Hotmail. More people I know have switched from Androids to iPhones, while continuing to use Gmail as their personal email on the iPhone.",
Android,"You must be bonkers to say people are ditching Gmail, it grows with every new android user just FYI, and current users such as myself can't think of ditching Google.",
Android,"Most people use android phones. You know that Android phone requires Gmail, right? Gmail is not ditched, but simply used to unlock some feature through internet.",
Android,"I would use apple mail
But im on android",
Android,Android is still the most popular OS on smartphones so I don't think Gmail has to worry since nearly every Android smartphone uses Gmail.. )^_-)/,
Android,"WTH is wrong with everyone? I have both and I dread every single time I have to check my outlook mail because it's unintuitive, slow and the search is utter trash. And don't even get me started on their android or windows app, those give me nightmares.",
Android,"The market shares presented here suggest that Apple's email Client dominates the market worldwilde on every plateform; this is complete nonsense. 
I've seen this kind of false data presented in many places in the last few months, where Apple is supposed to dominate. For mobiles, Android has over 70% market share, and for computers, Windows has 76%. Apple is not making much effort to make its Mail offer available on these platforms. Under these conditions, I don't see how they could take nearly 40% of the email solutions market share on competing platforms. Let's suppose they already have around 20% with their platforms, I'm generous, they lack 37% to reach the 57% mentionned in the video. It looks like Litmus is referring to email Clients on Apple platforms only.",
Android,"Nah, as long android phone exist, gmail not going anywhere. Even apple user mostly have gmail anyway",
Android,"Even everytime I have to use Android, I will install Outlook client app rather than GMAIL",
Android,"🤔 for me I noticed the contrary, no one pays for MS Office because Google docs are free... and there is more Android and almost no one uses Apple products unless you are into graphics design... the mayority uses Android.",
Android,But only half of all phone users are Apple. So either that graph is wrong or android users really like Apple email,
Android,"G mail is part of Google.When you search for something on google,within minutes you are bombarded with adverts relating to your search,no matter how much you try to deny access.They are the biggest spy network on the planet.That is why I hate it.Because I use an android device,I have no access to anything without having a g mail.Lets call it slavery.",
Android,I dont like Gmail either... Gimme  MS OL every time...  matter of fact i have OL  on my Mac\android devices.,
Android,"This is actually true _for me._ I'm only among my schoolmates and whole family who use Outlook for Email. Everybody else just stuck with Gmail.
People just use the default app for everything.
Android is just a client to Google Massive Ecosystem.",
Android,"Since no one else seems to notice this, I'll point it out. The market share that graph is referring to is Client market share. When it says Apple has 59.5% of the market, it means Apple's mail clients, not iCloud email. When it refers to Gmail, it is referring to the web gmail client and the iOS and Android apps of the Gmail client. I have a gmail account, but I access it through Apple Mail on my iPhone. This would be reported under Apple on this graph, despite the fact that I'm using the gmail service. Gmail is still very dominant in terms of the service people are using, it's just that most people use the included mail app on their phone to access their gmail account.",
Android,I continue to use Gmail as it's integration particularly is attractive with my android mobile. Sceptical about hacking in other mails(after using them for quite sometime). well I am not convinced as a personal user that other mails are close to the level of integration and storage like gmail,
Android,"The most stupid analysis.. Apple market share for smartphones in the world .. not just the US ..the world .. is around 16% .. including the strong iphone markets in the US and Europe. But overall.. Apple is competing not only with Samsung.. there is Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei etc etc.. so by default .. Android has a way higher market share.. so does Gmail.. because in the world.. the US, UK and Canada are the main users of Apple Computers including MacBooks. These are too uncommon in the rest of the world.. because they cost way too much. So in this market another American company is leading the way.  It's Microsoft with windows... By 9 to 1 ..
Even iPhone/iPad users have Gmail.. most iPhone users I know.. use Gmail or an other email provider. 
So.. these fairy tales of Apple high market shares.. are totally true for the US and Canada.. some parts of Europe.. but millions and millions of people in South America... Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa.. do you really think.. it's common for the general public to buy a 1000$ phone? In most cases in these areas of the world.. especially Asia and Africa..people don't have a computer.. but they have a phone.. and with that phone.. an email address.. think of the people in India alone.. 1.3 billion.. how many have a cheap asian phone running Android.. and how many have a 1000$ iphone.. think for yourself.. or massive countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines.. Nigeria, Egypt ... So think for yourself.. how big is the market share? 

Don't believe these pro Apple fake numbers ..these are BS",
Android,"interesting. do we mean just 'mobile' as that line has been blurred for some time. Personally, I use gmail & calendar as I've been on Android since the HTC Desire days, still using Yahoo mail as it was a 'third party' and they are still around and mostly Outlook for my Microsoft services. I use yahoo for 'socials' and 2 outlook accounts - one for 'official' stuff and one for 'shopping'. Because WhatsApp is now so widely used, it's more convenient to send small files (pics & video) using this and keep eMail for longer text.",
Android,Outlook app for android is rebranded Accompli is not allowed for work in many organizations,
Android,Nope. Gmail will always stuck with us. Especially for android users. You should do more research.,
Android,"i use the 3 worst ones. my isp uses yahoo, we have hotmail and gmail for our android phones. i don't care about any of them, they are just necessary.",
Android,"There just more options that people are becoming aware of, but usually people are sticking to the default choices.
- Apple users will have an icloud address (because afaik iOS requires them to have one),
- Android users will have a Gmail address (because afaik they require[d] one)
- Previous users of MSN will have a hotmail address (because afaik they require[d] one)
- Businesses will hand out outlook addresses (because they use Windows).
- Nearly everyone will have a redundant e-mail address with their ISP (because they usually generate one for free).

Meanwhile, i'm paying two separate webhosts to handle my e-mail, and i dislike all of the above mentioned providers equally.",
Android,"More people are using Android around the world, so it is unlikely that the Apple email client has the most market share. And the average Joe doesn't think about privacy.

I think the main reason why Gmail is losing market share is because the Gmail interface has not kept up with the times. I use Gmail to collate all my email into one place, but earlier this year, Microsoft turned off Basic Auth which prevented me from using Gmail to get email from Outlook/Exchange accounts. Now I use Outlook because that's where I can see all my email in one place.",
Android,"I don't need to watch this video because no one is (or very few people are) ditching Gmail. Gmail is the best free email service on the market, and it is mandatory  with every Android user. So, if anything, more and more people are joining Gmail so that they can use their Androids.",
Android,"I don't want to use icloud email because it just feels unreliable to me, I am not sure if I'll use iphone for the rest of my life and never switch to android. But for email, I definitely would want to use the same email for the rest of my life. With gmail, I can use it on both.",
Android,"Cannot see much of a reason to change ship as so much of my activity is around or helped by Google's services: logins to different websites, Youtube, Android phone, Gmail, Google Maps with thousands of saved bookmarks/waypoints, rarely also Chrome (mostly as backup as the primary browser is Firefox), Google Drive for easy sharing files, Classroom, Google Meet etc. I realize their robots scan for relevant content in my email, but I expect nothing else from the other big guys, let's be realistic.

And sorry, but I cannot see anything better for now; I hate the MS Teams and MS email, they are such a bad user experince! And of course, that is why MS is pushing their browser, too.

Apple right now is pushing the others out not for the users' sake, but for replacing Google/Fb/whatever's ads with Apple ads. So their privacy preference is BS, they are just replacing others with theirs and most people have no idea, justbswallow their marketing lines. If I remember it right, they were even caught quite recently with sending data.",
Android,Gmail numbers are extremely inflated by literally being mandatory for using mainstream android devices. I dont even wanna Gmail. Its shit and i am much happier with local alternative.,
Android,"I have like more than 10 Gmails I had the feeling that Google may involve in our life. However, it gives us a lot of features like google photo, Drive (docs, sheets..) and so on. It is not like I am a simp, but as long as android remains Gmail wont die. Dont forget windows phone and Lumia died because of google.",
Android,"Hi, The stats has some errors. Apple market under 20% share vs Android market share  about 70%+ and how 20% os can have 50% mail client market share I did not understand?",
Android,"Great video. If you are using any Android phone you are obliged to have a Gmail account. However for my business I use Microsoft Office 365. Privately I use Proton mail. I have a Gmail account, but I barely use it. I do not trust Google. You are the product, being a user. They sell all your data to their costumers. That's not the case with Apple nor with Microsoft. Google and Facebook have the same business model. Collecting and selling their users data.",
Android,Do people actually use their apple email addresses? That number is kind of flawed since you have one if you own an iPhone or an apple id . Kind of the same with Gmail with Android,
Android,"Email accounts are far from exclusive.  I have had a Hotmail account since it's inception; I was a beta tester in 1994.  I have yahoo, gmail, and a number of other free account.  I have avoided use of ISP provided accounts for portability reasons.  Having an Android phone pretty much makes having a Gmail account.   Hotmail is the account I use for personal and business purposes.  I prefer it because it has the ""exclusive"" security option which sends ALL emails that don't match my contact list to the junk folder.  Additionally it forced them to text so any embedded malware is disabled.  Anything in my inbox is something I pre-approved.  It is so scan subject headers in junk to see if there are things of interest then delete everything with a click.  This includes marketing from business accounts, notification of statements, and push more stuff I don't really want.   I haven't see anything close with any other email client.",
Android,"If we talks about email usage only, for sure there is many other alternatives, Outlook is the best answer because dominance of Windows OS on Personal Computer. But no one can deny, every living Android devices gonna need gmail account to work properly. So their dominance isn't going to die (soon).",
Android,"Outlook is horrible to use sometimes. The search is abysmal, it's really hard to find what I''m looking for. The mobile app (at least on Android) lacks a lot of features (e.g. send later).",
Android,"I use Gmail since I received the invitation many years ago. The advantage of Gmail is its zero downtime and the integration with the Android profile on the smartphone. With any Android handset, you must have a Gmail account even if you don't use it. That is to download apps, and a place to store photos and whatsapp backups, as an example.
I'm done with Microsoft Office since it went online. The greatest version of Office is Office 2003, the last to use traditional menus before they switched to that stripe or banner menus. I mean, I'm writing a book, I don't want to be online to do it! Software-as-a-service is the worst thing to have happened to computer users, ever. Google docs was born as online service and is good enough when you are doing collaboration work, but not when you use your computer as a typewriter...",
Android,"Am I the only one who uses Gmail because I was forced to?
I use Outlook for my personal and social media email. Gmail only for logging into Android and Youtube",
Android,"I've move to Outlook this year because for cheaper price(family plan) i got bigger storage for cloud and microsoft office.
Moreover outlook is just better for organizing email with their automation, Goolge only have promotion and social media sort, if theres feature like outlook for gmail then they need to make it more simple to set up or more visible. Because I've use gmail since 2011 and i cant find this features.

Overall outlook is the best for me and i never look back now my gmail is just log in to my android XD.",
Android,Lets not forget android smartphones as part of the conversation of forced adoption but how it's not working with Huawei no more has an impact on users especially in the Asian market or Africa,
Android,"Corporate is massive on Microsoft environment..and hence we all get outlook by default. 

Also Microsoft Teams, that is also absolute beast as workspace app. 

For my phone I have Gmail. It's convenient in Android",
Android,"I'm using Android phones, Youtube Premium, also, I pay for Google drive, but my main client is Outlook.",
Android,"Google may have reached market saturation, with forced adoption almost everyone that has an Android device already have a Google account & Gmail already existing for years on end.
For work - Outlook
For personal use - Apple
For Android use - Google account",
Android,mail client: thunderbird for Linux and k9 for Android,
Android,"Flawed logic.  You can use Gmail to open a Microsoft account.  And both MS and Apple ""force"" you to use their email service.  Microsoft has a lot of business support, so everyone has an MS business address but their personal address is more linked to the type of phone you use.  So the one big aspect you didn't even mention is the relative market share of iphone vs Android users.  This is a fail video.  Unsubscribing for wasting my time with clickbait.",
Android,Every android mobile holder be like ...hmmmm wait a second,
Android,"This video is based on BS data.
1. Android has 80% market share, than how could Apple mail client have 60% market share. Either Android user are using Apple mail client on Android ?? Which is unlikely.",
Android,Gmail is well integrated with the google suite of apps and android. And most of the planet uses android.,
Android,"How can Apple have 60% market share, when Android smartphones essentially require a gmail and they represent the vast majority of smartphones out there....?",
Android,"And this video just caused me to finally unsubscribe from this channel. Misinfo and assumptions and a misleading clickbait title for the sake of clicks. 

The reduction in 'opens' is directly correlated by Apple device usage. That isnts ""abandonment"". Its people using the native client built into their phone. That number will fluctuate greatly as Android and Apple PHONE market share go up and down and they exchange blows. 

And people using an email doesnt mean they dont STILL use gmail. I have a yahoo account and an Icloud acount both of which still I use. Yahoo for business, Icloud (my work phone from company is iphone),  Gmail for personal.",
Android,"About the only thing I used Google for is as a search engine and a browser. I stopped using their office products because I wasn't seeing much in the way of updates and the interface has remained completely static for over a decade. Google is also horrific at advertising and/or promoting their product offerings. I mean, I have had android phone since near when they first came out.....I still don't know of an android equivalent to Facetime or whatever the drop thing is call in apple...I don't think it exists in android.",
Android,"Personally, I think the big problem with Google is that they don't keep products long enough to let it grow and Google seems to only be focused truly on search, android, youtube, maps and ads...",
Android,"11:10 _""...the truth with Bard is that it doesn't matter how good it is because people have already made up their minds about Bard. And that's why Google Bard doesn't stand a chance even if it's better than ChatGPT.""_

Waaayyy too premature. The whole AI thing just begun. A lot of things can happen. Mainly a Bard integrating voice assistent in Android for example. Then people with Android phones are going to use it by default. 

Also it mainly depends on how many Software Developers are going to be happy with ChatGPT, Bard and lets not forget Metamate. They are the ones using AI heavily to generate code.",
Android,I switched to a pixel from Samsung and I have so much less customization and since android is supposed to be the customization king I felt like I got scammed buying a phone from the company that makes android.

Android,"Alright, some clarifications on Live Photos and RAW after some of you pointed it out: 

- Live Photos are visible on the iPhone, but functionality is limited to export video (no frame changing, or loop animations). 
- Also, Live Photos didn't seem to work cross-device. A Live Photo on my iPhone doesn't show up as Live on the web version, and I didn't find a way to export the original from web or Android. 
- Some RAW photos are supported, such as the DNG format. However, the standard sony ARW format is not. I found problems with support for Canon CR2 as well. 
- Furthermore, there are no additional editing tools for RAW photos. Apple does provide some additional exposure settings when the image is in RAW.",

I am concerned I will need to sort through thousands of photos and recreate albums.  Any help would be appreciated.",
Android,"Google photos is just more easier to use. I mean, with time, anyone can learn both the apps intensively but Google Photos, for me, took a few minutes to figure out. It's just so much easier and it being on Android and Apple means in future all I need to do is install the App and the photos and videos are just there. It's just more accessibility. I just can't bother to try to master whatever maybe hidden feature on Apple Photos as Google Photos just has everything for my need.",

Android,"Also, I would rather use Google Photos since I'm able to back-up and keep all my photos and videos no matter what device or platform I'm using. (Using Google Photos on Android, though, is a much better experience since it'll back up in the background on its own, as I snap away. Also provides me with ""Free up space"" on my device so that I NEVER need to delete pictures just to install an app (smh). Using Apple Photos will simply add limitations for me.",

Android,"3:00 In Russia, there is a law that obliges banks to set up bank terminals to accept contactless payments (including via a smartphone).  Therefore, if the store has a terminal, then in any case you can pay with Apple Pay / Google Pay / Samsung Pay (before sanctions).  Thanks to this, the number of places where Apple Pay is accepted (6 months after the launch) in Russia overtook the number of places in the USA (Apple Pay has been there for 2 years already).  P.S.  After the imposition of sanctions, almost nothing has changed (Google Pay was replaced by MirPay on Android)",
Android,"3:54 You can store your CC info in a locked note in Notes on iPhone or OneNote on Android. You can then only access the note using biometrics / password.

I use GPay whenever I can because I can review my purchases by merchant across all cards. This makes it really easy to find out how much I spent on groceries at the end of the month because GPay consolidates all the info for me. I don't have to look at different CC statements.",

Again this has happened on eight different phones over the years, though Google owned waze, it converted to an independent app in 2022. My roommate has an Apple phone and she runs in some of these issues as well, so it's not an Android issue. 

Also lacking in ways is picking an alternate route when you pass a turn it wants you to make. It will keep telling me to turn around for several miles. Waze is garbage in my experience.",

Well on eight different phones waze has given me ridiculously wrong instructions. It will tell me to turn on a street that doesn't exist on my side of town. When I'm leaving my house to go to the other side of town it'll tell me to do a u-turn. There's one point where I could just go across the street to get to the other side, but NO, waze wants me to make a left turn, then go right, get back on the main road I was about to cross, then go to the traffic light, and turn left to get to the other side.
